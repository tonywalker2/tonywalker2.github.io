When wet, coffee grounds are reduced to a thick, thickly loaded heap of mush, which can clog drain lines and result in severe plumbing concerns.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no neighboring energies or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
