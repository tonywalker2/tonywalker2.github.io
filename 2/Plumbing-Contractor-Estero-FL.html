After they provided me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, because I never wish to see this company once again.</p>

Loosen the nuts that connect the drain pipe, including the curved trap, at the sink drain and near the wall or floor. Use your hands for PVC connections or a pipe wrench for metal connections.
