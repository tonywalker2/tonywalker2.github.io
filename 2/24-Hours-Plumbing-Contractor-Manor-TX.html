<p>Tru-Soft Â® Solar Brine Blocks are produced for the requirements of many water softener systems. Recent Review: Howard, the Job Manager, has always been practical and helpful concerning all our issues. He did the proposition and arranged the work for the clear out and partial sewer line repair quickly. It is constantly a satisfaction to deal with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outside kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He was able to get a snake around the "Y", which many plumbers state they can't do, and clear the line. He is always enjoyable, professional and goes above and beyond.</p>
<p>We had a fantastic experience with Joe Boyette, he was very professional, polite, qualified. We had a great deal of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month duration. We also had to replace a bathroom and a water heater unassociated to the fire, but we felt great in Joe's capabilities. We made the decision to stick with Joe, although we felt Mr Rooter costs were absolutely on the high end. This being posted by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>
