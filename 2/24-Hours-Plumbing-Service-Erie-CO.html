<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the very first most apparent signs of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic issue such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a bigger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent severe damage to your home. Even if the issue comes from with the municipal system, it's still wise to generate the experts to restrict the damage to your home.</p>
<p>Another method to deal with a clog is by using a chemical cleaning item or if you fear they may be too extreme on your pipes, you can try old home remedies like hot water, vinegar, and baking soda. If you've attempted everything and the clog remains, call Plumb Perfect Plumbing and inquire about our clogged toilet repair service.

The dip tube inside the tank may be cracked if the water is lukewarm. Scalding water is usually the result of a damaged pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water is dangerous and need to be instantly attended to by a trained plumbing professional.</p>
