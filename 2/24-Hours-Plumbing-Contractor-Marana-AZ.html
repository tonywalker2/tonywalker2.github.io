It must likewise be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet).

The Pipe Pull technique interchanges harmed sewer or water lines with new piping by the use of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into location. All brand-new replacement pipes have a predicted life-span of one hundred years and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another reliable method is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically eliminates the need for broken pipe elimination.
