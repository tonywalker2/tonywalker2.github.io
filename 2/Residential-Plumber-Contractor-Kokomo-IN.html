<p>Examine the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is low-cost and easy. However finding the ideal washer might not be. The most common washers are often available at home centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be hard to find. If you choose to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the store to discover a match. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
