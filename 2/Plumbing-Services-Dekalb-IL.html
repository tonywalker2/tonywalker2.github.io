I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole.
