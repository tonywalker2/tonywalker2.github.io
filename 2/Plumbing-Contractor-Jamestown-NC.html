Water pressure may be or stop working lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
