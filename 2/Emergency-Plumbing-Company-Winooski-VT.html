<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
