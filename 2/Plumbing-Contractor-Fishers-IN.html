<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
