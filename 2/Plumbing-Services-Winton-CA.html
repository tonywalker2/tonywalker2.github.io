If the DEP has actually not gotten certification from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being set up within that time, a Notification of Offense will be sent. Violators will be accountable for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 released by the Environmental protection Board (ECB).
