<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing procedure consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive material.

In severe cases, hard-water deposits can significantly restrict the water circulation, which puts unnecessary pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

<p>Rust is an intricate phenomenon and there are many aspects that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water circulation system and property plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that speed up deterioration Likewise, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of corrosion control. Therefore, considering all these aspects, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and figure out the cause of the issue. The line was clearly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
