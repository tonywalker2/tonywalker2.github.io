However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then remove the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the offender. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper.

Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
