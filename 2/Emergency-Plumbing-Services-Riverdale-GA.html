<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
