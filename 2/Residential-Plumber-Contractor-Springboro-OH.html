<p>Lots of bad things are being stated on this post about liners. I discover that lots of old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no idea on what they are stating. Because they do not like the technology and not since it doesn't work, will also say something doesn't work well just. If this heater is set up in a home with multiple restrooms, the piping process contributes to the installation costs.</p>
