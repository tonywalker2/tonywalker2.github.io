<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc developed and developed a smaller model that ran on the exact same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise built a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big industrial and local sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
