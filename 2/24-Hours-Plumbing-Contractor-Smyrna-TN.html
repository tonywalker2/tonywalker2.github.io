Grease: Never ever put grease, fats, or oils down your kitchen sink. Instead of removing, these materials often harden to form nasty obstructions, which you may need a plumber to get rid of.</p>
<p>To make placing a toilet much easier, brand-new toilet bolts are extra long. That implies you need to cut off the extending ends later with a hacksaw.

<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals come with device wires attached, and others do not. Eliminate the cover plate beneath the disposal and connect the wires according the producer's guidelines if yours does not. Most standard disposals have you connect white wires to white wires and black wires to black wires. When you're finished, screw the cover plate back on.</p>
