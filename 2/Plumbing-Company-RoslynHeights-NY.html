If everything is all set, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be customized, changed, or transferred to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours required and therefore the overall expenses. Most plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with a lot of disposal setups running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor costs roughly $150.</p>
