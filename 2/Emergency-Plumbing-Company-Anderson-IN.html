<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Anderson IN?</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system needs to be constantly kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
