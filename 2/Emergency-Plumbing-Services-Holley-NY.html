<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a significant clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
