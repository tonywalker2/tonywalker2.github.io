<h3>Getting Blocked Sewer Drainage Solutions at Chicago IL</h3>
<p>We are a licensed and insured  drain cleaning contractor who can clean out difficult drain clogs and leave them working fresh once again. The typical cost to install a gas line for a kitchen stove is $15 to $25 per direct foot. Overall costs vary from $200 to $1,000 or more depending upon the length of piping needed to connect to the main gas supply, which generally averages 30'.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. The majority of house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>Inside the house, check the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for leakages or drips. Check beneath sinks to check for leaking pipes. Local plumber estimated price of $400 to install plus cost of garbage disposal. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ pleased I inspected around. Under the sink, position a pail or pan below the waste pipe, then use locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to disconnect the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's waste pipe. To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
