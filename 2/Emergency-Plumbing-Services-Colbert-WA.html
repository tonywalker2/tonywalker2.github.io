<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain.

Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's harder to eliminate.</p>
