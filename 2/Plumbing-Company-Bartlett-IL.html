<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
