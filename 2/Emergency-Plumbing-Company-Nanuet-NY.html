<p>To decrease the need of gas line repair, it is necessary to understand the common reasons for gas leaks. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning appliances take place most commonly in the winter. This is because houses are not adequately aerated throughout the cooler months to prevent heat loss. If you haven't done so currently, we advise setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bed room doors to inform you of any possible gas leaks.</p>
<p>Next comes the metal mount ring and rubber cushion install (or cushion ring). Their appropriate orientation will be labeled. These 2 pieces have complementary grooves that when properly fitted together hold the install ring and disposal in location. Holding the mount ring at the topmost part of the flange, work the cushion mount over the bottom of the flange, making sure that the rubber of the cushion install is totally and strongly locking into the groove on the bottom of the flange. When installed properly, you ought to not be able to eliminate the cushion mount without significant stretching and pulling, and the install ring ought to rotate easily around it.</p>
