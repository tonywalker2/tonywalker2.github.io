<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Pasadena CA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
