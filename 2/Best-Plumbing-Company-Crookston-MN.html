<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Crookston MN</h3>

<p>Learn if there are any lead pipes in the home. Residences that were developed prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how beneficial, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based).

<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
