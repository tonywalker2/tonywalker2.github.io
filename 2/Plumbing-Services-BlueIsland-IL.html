<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, however if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>

Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
