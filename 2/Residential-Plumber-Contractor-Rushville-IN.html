<h3>Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Plumbers Rushville IN</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
