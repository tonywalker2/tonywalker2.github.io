<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has often been misunderstood as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due mostly to overstated marketing and, in part, to customer misconceptions about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening merely eliminates hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are an annoyance and not a threat to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not necessity. However, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
<p>Press the tip of a screwdriver up versus the edge of the plug and tap until you break loose the plug.

We have complete self-confidence that we can handle any kind of repair you throw at us.</p>
