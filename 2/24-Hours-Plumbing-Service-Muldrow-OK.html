The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and avenues, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
