<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that individuals anticipate to see however seldom stop to think of. 106.2.2.1 Other than Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent guideline exemptions in Area 106.2.2 shall apply to small repairs and replacement piping only. In buildings besides Group R-3 occupancies, an authorization and inspection will be required for more comprehensive work if more than 10-percent (nominal) of a floor level, wing, or area is involved, although the floor level, wing, or area defines less than 10-percent (nominal) of the total building plumbing.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical service is to have the defective pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in.

Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for numerous years, however steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and lacks the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
