<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most obvious signs of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy issue such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a bigger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid severe damage to your house. Even if the problem originates with the municipal system, it's still wise to generate the professionals to limit the damage to your home.</p>
<p>Common repairs do not solve the issue. If it appears you're constantly experiencing plumbing problems, it's probably a problem you can't fix without professional aid. A licensed plumber can not only discover that cause of the issue but securely repair or replace your main sewer line if required.
