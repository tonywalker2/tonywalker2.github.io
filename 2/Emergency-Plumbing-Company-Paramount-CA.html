<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leakages happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these concerns.</p>
<p>If you home utilizes a septic system and drain field, you'll need an unique disposal. The system needs to grind the waste even finer to prevent blockages and permit the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields. Your water expenses keep increasing. You begin monitoring shower times and decreasing the number of laundry loads you do, however the price continues to increase. This could indicate you have a sewer line leak.</p>
