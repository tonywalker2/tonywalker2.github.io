<h3>Necessity of Sewer Line Inspection in RainbowCity AL and Its Procedures</h3>
<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets need to absolutely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet must be replaced. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural stability of the house.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
