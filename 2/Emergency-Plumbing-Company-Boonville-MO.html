If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to assist separate the material. Also, germs and fungis also form mats in the resin that reduce its effectiveness. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these nuisances.
