While a high quality, high horse power disposal can grind and press almost anything down the kitchen sink, it does not mean it benefits the pipes. Gas shut-off valve installation expenses between $52 and $138 per home appliance, consisting of labor and products. Materials cost $15 to $50 per valve, while labor runs $45 to $150 per hour. A shut-off valve is required to shut down the gas to the home whenever a device needs repair or for emergencies.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this method, you know the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
