<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets need to definitely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural stability of the house.</p>
<p>Great deals of bad things are being stated on this article about liners. I discover that lots of old time plumbers are not informed on liners and have no hint on what they are stating.
