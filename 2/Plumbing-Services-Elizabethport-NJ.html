After eliminating standing water from the sink, put about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain prior to you gather the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and after that flush with warm water to clear the mix.</p>

<p>Water softeners been available in all sizes and shapes and larger definitely does not suggest better. WaterBoss ® utilizes great mesh resin - smaller sized beads that in fact supply more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to allow optimal capacity in a minimum of space.

It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too.
