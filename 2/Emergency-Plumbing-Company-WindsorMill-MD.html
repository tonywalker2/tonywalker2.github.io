<p>Normally, there are tank water heaters that use either gas or electrical power for their fuel. Natural gas tank systems utilize practically 50% less energy, costing less to operate, than the electrical range. However, they cost a bit more than electrical models. They also feature a temperature and pressure-release valve that opens when either temperature level or pressure exceeds predetermined levels. We offer gas water heater service, in addition to electrical hot water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Shore.</p>
