Often, however, the damage is so substantial that you either need to replace the whole toilet, or the cost of repairs is so big that replacement is simply a more useful option. This generally involves fractures in the toilet bowl itself, widespread rust over several elements, or simply since you  want to replace your existing toilet with something more visually pleasing.</p>
