<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be restored (cleaned up). Salt is typically utilized in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>
