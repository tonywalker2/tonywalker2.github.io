For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that accelerate rust Also, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of rust control. Hence, thinking about all these factors, in addition to arise from research studies, WQA's position is that a correctly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
