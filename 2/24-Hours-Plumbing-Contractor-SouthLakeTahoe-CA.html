However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of home centers bring only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall.
