<p>The customer has thirty days to complete installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (check the due date on Notification of Requirements form).

<p>Repiping is not a short-lived fix. It's a permanent service for the whole plumbing system in your house or company. We switch off the water supply, remove old pipe and replace it with new pipe.
