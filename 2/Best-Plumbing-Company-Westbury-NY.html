<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
