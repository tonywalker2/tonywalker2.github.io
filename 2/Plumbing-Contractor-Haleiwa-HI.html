<p>Improperly set up gas lines result in gas leakages. Gas leaks are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy job. The gas lines have to be adjusted to the best levels by a certified professional. The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the second highest energy consuming area of a house, next to heating & cooling. The amount of minerals liquified in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can take place when there is a sudden decrease in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as throughout fire fighting or when a water pipe breaks.
