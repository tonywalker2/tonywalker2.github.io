<p>New houses developed with copper pipes are particularly vulnerable to destructive water conditions since the copper pipes have actually not had a possibility to end up being coated inside. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new house for a period of 3 to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Lots of new houses are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>
