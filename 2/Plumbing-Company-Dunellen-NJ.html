<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Dunellen NJ</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains substantial amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a problem-- for its lots of intended uses around your home.</p>
