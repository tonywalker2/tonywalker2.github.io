For gas water heaters, a particular gas line needs to be set up and a viable source of gas developed. Another feature of an electrical water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas models need to be aerated correctly utilizing vents and ducts in order to function properly. With electric designs, you will not need to install any new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continually bringing tanks on-line and off-line in response to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, only one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design enables the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
