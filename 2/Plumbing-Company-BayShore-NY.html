Like any home appliance, a toilet tank features many small moving parts that might need replaced with usage gradually. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and cause toilet leakages that aren't plainly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
