<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Chesapeake VA</h3>
<p>Corrosion: The most common issue is rust in the tank and pipes that connect to your water heater. This is specifically true if you have without treatment hard water, which contains harsh minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the material in time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another aspect that is causing the rust, you will eventually experience a leak in your water heater that is difficult to repair. Leaks typically mean a new unit replacement is in order.</p>
<p>To identify if your house is a poly home," begin with the outside. Underground water pipe are normally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Often, it goes into the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is connected to completion of the water pipe. Ensure you check both ends of the pipe.

<p>In general, toilets are quite simple to operate and repair. Nearly any part can be eliminated and changed reasonably quickly and rapidly The flipside of the toilet's low maintenance nature is, when it has a problem, the stakes are high. Damaged toilets can do some really substantial, expensive, and ... smelly damage to a home. When something fails, and your kitchen sink draws back up, your toilet won't flush, or you can't shower, you need for professional assistance immediately. That's where High 5 Plumbing is available in. With years of market experience, we know how to tackle a wide array of drain problems.</p>
<p>Standard tank-type water heaters include steel cylinders that are fed by a water pipe that dips into a large tank. The water inside this tank is warmed up and after that released into the pipes of your house through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank consists of the temperature and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you go beyond a preset level. You'll likewise find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control unit outside for setting temperatures and controlling the pilot-light valve.</p>
