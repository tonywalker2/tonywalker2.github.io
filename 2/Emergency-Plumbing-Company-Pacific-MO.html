The typical labor cost to install a gas line is $3 to $11 per linear foot depending on the diameter of the pipe and task intricacy. Licensed plumbers charge between $45 to $150 per hour, or $100 an hour on average to position new gas lines.</p>
<p>You need to spend at least $50 to get a high-quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a reliable stopper and a resilient surface mechanism. The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop design stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can wear, however screwing it in and out can be irritating. The twist-and-drop design is much easier to utilize but requires occasional -ring replacement.</p>
