After all, if the trip lever does not lift the flapper to flush the toilet, you have to jiggle and wiggle and often even stick your hand in there and raise the flapper manually. And who wishes to do all that work??? In all seriousness though, making certain your journey lever is working well can save you the trouble of those small everyday troubles - that many people just deal with and never understand they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to discuss the gallons of water squandered every day by a bad seal.</p>

The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system.
