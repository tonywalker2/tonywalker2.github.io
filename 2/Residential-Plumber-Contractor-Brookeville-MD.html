<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps catch moisture and sediment so that they do not go into the control system. Unlike a drip leg, the circulation of the gas is altered to get rid of any sediment. A sediment trap may be included in a drip leg install. The City requires backflow prevention devices to be installed anywhere there exists a connection that might enable tainted water into the City system or private plumbing. These devices are subject to testing by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In many cases, they undergo regular tests later on, also.</p>

Gradually sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can hinder efficiency, and draining a gallon approximately helps remove the sediment.

To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to consider repiping your whole home when you find a leak.</p>
