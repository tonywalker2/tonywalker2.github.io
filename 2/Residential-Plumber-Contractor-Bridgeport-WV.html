Unlike a drip leg, the flow of the gas is altered to remove any sediment. A sediment trap may be included in a drip leg install. The City requires backflow prevention devices to be set up anywhere there exists a connection that might allow tainted water into the City system or personal plumbing. These devices undergo testing by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In a lot of cases, they undergo routine tests later on, as well.</p>
