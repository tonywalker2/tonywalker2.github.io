<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber MissionHills CA</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
