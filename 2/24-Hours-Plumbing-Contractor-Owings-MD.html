<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
