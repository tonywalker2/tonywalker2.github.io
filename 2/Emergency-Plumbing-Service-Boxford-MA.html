<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and elsewhere throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and conduits, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
