<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Allendale MI</h3>
<p>Repiping a house takes 3 to 5 days with an average cost from $5,500 to $8,500, depending upon home's size and the company doing the work. Wood suggests inspecting the certifications of numerous companies and getting estimates. With all this in mind, it's clear why water softeners are so popular: They remain the least expensive and most reliable way to rid your water of troublesome minerals.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
