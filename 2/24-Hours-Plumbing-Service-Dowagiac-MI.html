<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is normal in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
