<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
