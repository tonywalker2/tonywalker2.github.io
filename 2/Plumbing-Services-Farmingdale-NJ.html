<p>The next action we must perform in the repair procedure, is to flush the incoming water line. After we have actually cleaned the body, and the repaired parts are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or debris. This can be difficult, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be made use of to assure the line is appropriately flushed.</p>
