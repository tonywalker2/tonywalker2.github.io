Our qualified and knowledgeable technicians utilize the current tools and innovative technology in all our work. We are a licensed, bonded and guaranteed plumbing company understood for our fast, comprehensive service.</p>
<p>From the above description of the working of a toilet, you can see that it is comprised of a number of mechanical parts which, with time, go through wear and tear and may need to be changed. Some homeowners have actually taken it upon themselves to find out how to replace these parts however many do not understand how to do it or can not do it well. This is where Matt's Plumbing would enter play. When in doubt, always provide us a call and we will fix any of your plumbing problems with the correct tools and years of competence. We will generally have these parts on hand - considering this is a very common problem - so you don't have to fret about buying them by yourself.

<p>A plumbing authorization offers 3 inspections. Additional inspections are $50.00 each. Inspections hired on work not finished, not correctly installed, or on an unattainable property will require re-inspection. It is the license holder's duty to reschedule the inspection and make arrangements for the plumbing inspector to access the home.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the reason for the issue. The line was plainly degrading; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
