<p>Inside the home, examine the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for leaks or drips. Examine beneath sinks to look for leaking pipes. Local plumber quoted cost of $400 to install plus cost of waste disposal unit. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ delighted I examined around. Under the sink, position a pail or pan underneath the drain, then utilize locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's waste pipe. To loosen up the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to inspect the line and determine the cause of the problem. The line was plainly deteriorating; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line could collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
