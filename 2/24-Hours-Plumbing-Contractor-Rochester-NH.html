<p>Two designs of PVBs are offered: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker.

<p>Water softeners can be found in all sizes and shapes and bigger definitely does not mean much better. WaterBoss ® utilizes fine mesh resin - smaller beads that in fact provide more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to enable maximum capacity in a minimum of space.

Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also protect the resin bed, so we do not need to waste area on freeboard" which is the empty area in conventional water softeners that permit a churning of resin throughout regeneration to release firmness, dirt and sediment.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the offender. However not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
