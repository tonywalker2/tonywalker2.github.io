<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
