<p>Next, test the flapper as shown in Photo 1. Water is most likely getting away through a cracked or rusted overflow tube if extra pressure on the flapper does not stop the running noise. Because case, you need to detach the tank from the bowl and replace the whole flush valve. Considering that the overflow tube is seldom the reason for a running toilet, we will not cover that repair here.</p>
