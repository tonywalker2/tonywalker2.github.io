<p>The next step we need to carry out in the repair procedure, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have actually cleaned the body, and the fixed elements are still out of the body, and we have finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be difficult, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is essential that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system needs to be used to assure the line is properly flushed.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health risk if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are various, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, caused the spread of illness or disease.</p>
