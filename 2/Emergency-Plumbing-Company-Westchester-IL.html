<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
