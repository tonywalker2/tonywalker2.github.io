<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

<p>When lime is added to the water, it alters the water chemistry, triggering the calcium to come out of the solution. The particles of calcium combine, become much heavier than the remainder of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next step of the treatment procedure. Flexible gas lines are normally preferable to inflexible lines, especially in locations where earthquakes are more common and for the connection in between the supply and device. Versatile gas lines are less likely to be detached in a natural catastrophe which reduces the risk of an explosion or fire.</p>
