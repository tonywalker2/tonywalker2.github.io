<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets must definitely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet must be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps compromise the structural stability of the home.</p>
