However if your toilet is exhibiting any of the following indications, it may be time to replace it. When a water account is established, we examine backflow requirements for companies on an individual basis. After eliminating standing water from the sink, put about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain before you gather the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and after that flush with warm water to clear the mix.</p>
