<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that controls water circulation in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't installed properly, you may experience an often or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>

With our professional garbage disposal replacement and installation services, you can be confident that you're all set for several years of reliable service. No, the glass will not sharpen the waste disposal unit blades. To clean and hone the blades, grind a few ice cubes in the disposal prior to running cold water through the unit. If that does not work, you'll need to install a brand-new system.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new home or just wish to ensure you know what is going in the sewer line of one you currently own, we'll send a camera down the entire length of your pipes.

Oftentimes the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and understanding this can save you countless dollars in repairs.

The specialists and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you always have a copy for your insurance coverage realtor, company or city inspector.</p>
<p>Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline prior to the issue became worse. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a very pricey alternative.</p>
