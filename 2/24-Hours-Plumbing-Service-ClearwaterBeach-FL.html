<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of significant surgical treatment, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it just implies old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes.

You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing frequent and significant leakages. If you do have frequent leakages, we discover that repiping can actually be the less expensive and much better long-lasting option.</p>
