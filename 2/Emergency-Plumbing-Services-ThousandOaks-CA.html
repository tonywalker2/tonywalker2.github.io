<p>A backflow preventer is a way or mechanism to prevent backflow. The basic means of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The fundamental system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
