<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in PleasantGrove UT!</h3>
<p>Deterioration is an intricate phenomenon and there are lots of aspects that accelerate rust in the drinking-water distribution system and premise plumbing. For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that speed up corrosion Also, there is a lack of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable type of deterioration control. Hence, thinking about all these aspects, along with results from research studies, WQA's position is that a properly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
