<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and identify the cause of the problem. The line was clearly degrading; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
