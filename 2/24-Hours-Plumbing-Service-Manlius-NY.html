Worms for irrigation systems: Citizens found parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the air pressure breaker malfunctioned on a privately owned underground sprinkler system.

<p>New houses built with copper pipes are particularly vulnerable to destructive water conditions because the copper pipes have not had a chance to end up being layered inside. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new house for a period of 3 to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of new houses are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>
