<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and figure out the cause of the problem. The line was plainly weakening; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
