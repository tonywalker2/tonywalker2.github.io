<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system must be continuously monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed.

Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
