<p>Corrosion is an intricate phenomenon and there are lots of aspects that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water circulation system and property plumbing. For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that speed up rust Likewise, there is a lack of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of deterioration control. Hence, thinking about all these aspects, along with results from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
