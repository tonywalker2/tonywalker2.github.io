<p>Backpressure might take place when the potable supply piping is linked to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping.

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the offender. But not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with too little slack can trigger difficulty too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
