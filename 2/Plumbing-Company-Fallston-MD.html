<p>Troubleshooting is a concern. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I face situations, frequently that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the task. Sometimes, the basements are so loaded with sewage, I can not securely go into the basement and run till the sewage is extracted and the basement is typically cleaned up.

<p>Due to the fact that the copper pipes have not had a chance to end up being covered inside, New homes constructed with copper pipes are particularly susceptible to destructive water conditions. As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a duration of three to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of new houses are built with PEX and not copper.</p>
