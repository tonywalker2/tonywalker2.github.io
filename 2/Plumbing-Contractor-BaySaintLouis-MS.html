With our professional garbage disposal replacement and installation services, you can be positive that you're all set for years of reliable service. No, the glass will not hone the garbage disposal blades. To clean and hone the blades, grind a few ice in the disposal prior to running cold water through the system. If that doesn't work, you'll need to install a new unit.</p>
<p>Blending evaporated salt with rock salt is not suggested, as this might clog the softening reservoir. It is suggested that you enable your unit to go empty of one type of salt prior to including another to prevent the event of any problems. In any case, when you're planning a water heater replacement, play it safe. If you need a license, call your local department of inspections and ask. And make sure a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
