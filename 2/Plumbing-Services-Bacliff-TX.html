Worms for irrigation systems: Homeowners found parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the atmospheric pressure breaker malfunctioned on an independently owned underground sprinkler system. During a water pressure drop, the vacuum in the system sucked some water from the sprinkler into the city water.

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are set up in locations where water might cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
