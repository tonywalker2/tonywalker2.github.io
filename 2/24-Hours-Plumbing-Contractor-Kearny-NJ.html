<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a significant clog that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
