We need our faucets and sinks to be functioning correctly in order to maintain safe and sanitary living conditions too.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a serious public health danger if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of illness or disease.</p>
<p>We provide quickly, same day service and will send an experienced professional to your house or service and do our best to guarantee that you have warm water again as rapidly as possible. Gurgling noises from a toilet are caused by air in the drain and ventilation system. A blocked toilet drain or vent line is the root problem. This needs a plumber to fix, but the good news is that your toilet most likely does not need to be changed.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham examines backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be checked by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report must be supplied to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in tough water can cause a bad smell and taste. When you include a water softener, it eliminates the mineral material to produce odor free drinking water that tastes good.</p>
