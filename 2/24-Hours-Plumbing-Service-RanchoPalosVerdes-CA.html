<p>After getting here after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after among the two gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together however claimed they would not take obligation if it dripped now because of some unspecified oddities in how my sink was assembled. After they provided me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, because I never want to see this company once again.</p>
<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
