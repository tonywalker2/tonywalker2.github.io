<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may have to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug kit that I purchased individually from the disposal system.

For this factor, it is highly advised you call a relied on plumber to deal with any stubborn drain problems that can not be treated with simple plunging.</p>
