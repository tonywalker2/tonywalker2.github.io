<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual choice. A license is not needed for repairs which involve just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages provided alterations are not made in the existing piping or components. A typical water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, broad brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a nearby drain or drywell.</p>
<p>Water temperature problems can be fixed by adjusting the temperature level on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be brought on by a blocked aerator screen. Property owners can simply loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>
