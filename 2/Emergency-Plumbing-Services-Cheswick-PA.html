<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing components inoperable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain appropriately or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help. In some cases drain repair needs can be resolved fairly quickly by an experienced handyman. At other times, nevertheless, parts of a drain might need to be disassembled, taken a look at, and cleared prior to being changed. Sometimes, a handyman may determine that a replacement part is needed (like a reducer, tailpiece, or pvc  trap) to ensure regular operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman representative today to talk about repair options.</p>

<p>Pull the two lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the harmed fuel lines. A little cylindrical fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank when you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer.

<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet at Cheswick PA</h3>
<p>As one of the most secondhand plumbing systems in your home, it's a given that your toilet will need repairs gradually. However if your toilet is showing any of the following signs, it may be time to replace it. When a water account is developed, we assess backflow requirements for services on a private basis. After getting rid of standing water from the sink, put about 1/2 cup of salt down the drain before you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and after that flush with hot water to clear the mix.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many house centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
