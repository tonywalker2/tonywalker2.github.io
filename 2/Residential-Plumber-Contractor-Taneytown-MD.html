<p>Badly installed gas lines lead to gas leaks. Gas leaks are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy project. The gas lines have to be adjusted to the ideal levels by a certified professional. The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the second highest energy consuming area of a house, beside cooling and heating. The quantity of minerals dissolved in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>

Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to eliminate.</p>
