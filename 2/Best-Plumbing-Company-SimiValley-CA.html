<p>To identify which toilet valve is triggering the problem, look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into television, there's an issue with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, consistent outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing entirely. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water discolorations and deterioration.
