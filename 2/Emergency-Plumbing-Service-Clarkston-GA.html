After we have cleaned the body, and the repaired parts are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet shut down to flush any rust or debris. This can be challenging, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is very important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system needs to be used to ensure the line is properly flushed.</p>
