Reattach the gas tank to the Weed Eater trimmer with the Torx screws that held it in place originally. Reattach the fuel lines to the carburetor in the very same positions as they were initially placed. Reconnect the trigger plug wire. A gas line will initially need to be ranged from the street to the house, a meter set up, followed by gas lines set up inside the house from the meter to the new home appliances. Expenses can vary considerably based on the complexity of the install, and what size pipe and connections each appliance needs.</p>
