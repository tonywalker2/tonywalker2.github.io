<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system needs to be continuously kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply means old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing regular and major leaks, you could be in need of water line repiping. We discover that repiping can in fact be the cheaper and better long-term solution if you do have frequent leaks.</p>

Another disadvantage of an electric hot water heater is that they can be costly to install, particularly when it pertains to whole-house tankless systems.</p>
