<p>Frequent leaks: Leakages coming from your water heater are never ever an excellent indication. If your hot water heater has regular leaks or is constantly needing repairs, it is likely more cost-effective to replace the entire unit. A backflow preventer is a device that's set up on your house's water pipes that permits water to stream in one instructions but never in the opposite instructions. Its sole job is to prevent drinking water from being polluted due to backflow.</p>
<p>If there are any lead pipes in the home, find out. Homes that were constructed prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how helpful, is an environmental toxin (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have kids, you may not wish to reside in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the cause of the problem. The line was plainly weakening; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line could collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
