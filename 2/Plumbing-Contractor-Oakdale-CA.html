Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
