<p>Climatic vacuum breakers (AVB) are the easiest style of backflow preventer. If you have less than six control valves, they are the least expensive, but also the least reliable choice. These devices are not created as a whole-system backflow prevention valve; one need to be installed at every control valve. Sprinkler Warehouse does not advise AVB's for waterings systems where there is a potential to contaminate drinking water. When one has actually failed, avb's are not testable and it is not possible to detect.</p>

<p>If you  wish to remove the salt, merely fill the salt water tank with potassium chloride pellets, not salt pellets. The only problem is that potassium chloride is costly: $25 to $30 per 50-pound bag. Salt costs $4 to $6 per bag. A hydro jetter is a pump-and-hose system that uses high-powered water jets to clear residential and commercial drain pipes. Most high-pressure water jetters will run with approximately 4,000 PSI of pressure and will press anywhere from 2-18 gallons of water per minute through a pipe.</p>
