<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and in other places during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and conduits, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
