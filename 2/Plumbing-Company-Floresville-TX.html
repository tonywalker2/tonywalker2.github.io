<p>Backflow preventers are critical for producing a safe water supply system. No matter which model you choose, all water softeners need to be correctly kept. The salt water option must be combined and stored in the brine tank. Routine obstructing of the resin likewise requires unique attention. For example, if the raw water system is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, normal backwashing with water will fix this problem. If not, gradually stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help separate the material. Similarly, fungis and bacteria also form mats in the resin that decrease its efficiency. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these problems. However, check out the maker's guidelines before adding any chemicals to the system.</p>
