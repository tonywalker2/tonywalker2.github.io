<p>Visible odor. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like odor) in the yard, basement, or throughout your home or company place, offer us a call. That odor may be coming from your sewer system, which needs repair work right away. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that removes sewage from your home, releases sewer gas, and regulates air pressure in the waste-system pipes has failed, it will often need to be changed rather than repaired. You'll understand this if your pipes are gurgling or producing nasty smells.</p>
<p>A lot of plumbers will get rid of the old system to install the new one at the same per hour rate. This can increase the amount of time required to install the new unit, therefore increasing costs. This really depends on what condition the remainder of the pipes are in, and how hard the old unit is to remove. In many cases, removal will just include an extra $25 to $50 to the total costs, however sometimes the expenses might be greater if extra pipes must also be changed.</p>

After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and figure out the cause of the issue.
