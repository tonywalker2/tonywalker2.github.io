<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Dorchester MA</h3>
<p>The appearance of your kitchen sink or bathroom sink can impact the total appearance of your home. Many house owners buy durable and stunning granite counter tops, marble counter tops, quartz countertops, and more since they think these are very durable and would last for many years. This is in fact true. In truth, counter tops made from stone even contribute to the value of your property. Nevertheless, you need to know that even if little maintenance is needed and possible sealing is needed every couple of years or two, unforeseen damages can still take place.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
