A credible company like Gene Johnson Plumbing & Heating can provide gas line installation to replace the broken pipe.</p>
<p>Procedure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it may need additional adapters, versatile tubing is far simpler to work with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
