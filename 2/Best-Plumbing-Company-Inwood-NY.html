<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a substantial blockage that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
