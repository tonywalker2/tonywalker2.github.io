<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Amsterdam NY</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system must be continually monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
