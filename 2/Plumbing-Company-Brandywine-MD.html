<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>One of the most typical bathroom plumbing problems to occur is a clogged toilet. In fact, much of us keep a plunger near our toilet in case it ever should clog. While a plunger can easily fix most clogs, sometimes toilets become totally overwhelmed with toilet tissue or non-flushable products. We suggest that you call in one of our professional plumbers to help you unclog your toilet when this takes place.</p>
<p>The key to the technology is being able to manage both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, therefore removing hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
