After we have actually cleaned up the body, and the repaired components are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet shut down to flush any rust or particles. This can be challenging, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is essential that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be utilized to ensure the line is properly flushed.</p>
