<p>Tru-Soft ® Solar Salt water Blocks are produced for the requirements of many water softener systems. Recent Review: Howard, the Task Supervisor, has always been practical and helpful regarding all our issues. He did the proposition and arranged the work for the clear out and partial sewer line repair without delay. It is always a pleasure to work with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outside kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He was able to get a snake around the "Y", which lots of plumbers state they can't do, and clear the line. He is always pleasant, professional and goes the extra mile.</p>
<p>Water softening describes the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- typically salt. The outcome is water that's been effectively softened by getting rid of almost all traces of the minerals that make up hard water.</p>
