<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and avenues, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>

<p>Your disposer may come with a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, instead of the traditional plumber's putty as detailed listed below. Both will develop a good seal (though the gasket may lead to percentages of water collecting around the flange), and what's utilized is mostly a matter of preference. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's harder to get rid of.</p>
