<h3>Hydro Scrub Jetting in Batavia Illinois</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had actually supported into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did a minimum of three attempts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his knowledge and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the debris decreased the newly cleaned main drain. By adding perseverence and patience the task was done to my total satisfaction.</p>
