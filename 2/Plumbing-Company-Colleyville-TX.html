A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in private residences, it likewise avoids wastewater in private homes from receding out and polluting the public water supply.</p>
<p>Our technician, Tom, was exceptional. He was comprehensive, thoughtful, discussed the work to be done, the cost, choices, and seemed to take the minimum amount of time to finish the work. The professional's helper, who occurred with Tom, was likewise a great asset. It was a. fantastic experience for us. But, it constantly is when we call James A. Wheat & Sons.

If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is developed to release and open water to the outside. An RPZ will regularly discharge percentages of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ must be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and permit adequate drainage.</p>
