<p>As an IMPORTANT SERVICES BUSINESS, we stay Available and open to help with any of your plumbing, drain, heating, cooling or electrical requirements. The waste disposal unit is among the most misused home appliances in the whole house. Couple of house owners recognize that a disposal is designed specifically to handle food residue washed from a plate-- not whole portions of leftovers! Large quantities of food can rapidly overwhelm the system and trigger a comprehensive clog. That's why Pratt Plumbing gets numerous call requesting garbage disposal repairs and maintenance.</p>

<h3>Sink Leaking in Kingston Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals feature appliance wires connected, and others do not. Get rid of the cover plate beneath the disposal and attach the wires according the manufacturer's instructions if yours does not. Most basic disposals have you connect white wires to white wires and black wires to black wires. Screw the cover plate back on when you're completed.</p>
<p>The list of things a food disposer can consume is relatively brief. Soft or crisp foods are great, but hard or stringy foods can be trouble. Disposers can be stopped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, along with the usual kitchen flotsam, consisting of pop-tabs, scouring twist-ties and pads.
