<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the glory in the toilet world, but the trip lever is the bridge in between guy and machine. After all, if the trip lever does not raise the flapper to flush the toilet, you have to jerk and wiggle and in some cases even stick your hand in there and lift the flapper by hand. And who wants to do all that work??? In all severity however, ensuring your trip lever is working well can save you the trouble of those little day-to-day inconveniences - that the majority of people just cope with and never ever understand they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to mention the gallons of water lost every day by a poor seal.</p>
<h3>Clogged Toilet in Warsaw Virginia</h2>
<p>In many cases, our technicians will recommend that you replace your hot water heater instead of purchase repairs. This is normally the case when the hot water heater is more than 10 years old or the cost of repairs would amount to majority the cost of an entire brand-new unit. Often a frustrating toilet just needs a minor modification and life is back to typical. That is why we offer a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) adjust the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) perform a color test.</p>

Worn impellers on older disposals can become inefficient, increasing the risk of drain blockages.</p>
