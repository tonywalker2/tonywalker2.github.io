We examine backflow requirements for organisations on an individual basis when a water account is developed. After removing standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain before you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a few minutes, and after that flush with hot water to clear the mix.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and inspect the flange and drain for leaks. Backflow - Do you discover water reappearing in your sink or shower?
