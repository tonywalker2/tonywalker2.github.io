<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>The system has actually gone back to an absolutely no need condition (no valves open downstream). Nevertheless, particles between the # 1 Inspect Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the components, is preventing the # 1 Inspect from closing all the method. This allows pressure to equalize between the Supply Side and the Zone of Reduced Pressure. When this occurs, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back versus the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capability and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system calculates the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately begins. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regrowth typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
