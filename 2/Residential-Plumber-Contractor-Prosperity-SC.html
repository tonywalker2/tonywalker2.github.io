<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to remove the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals bring positive charges, so water softeners use salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you water with safe and clean water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, potable and irrigation, you are likewise needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

<p>Another common misperception is that calcium-carbonate scale is an effective type of rust control. There is a lack of clinical evidence supporting this claim, however. Scale does not form in uniform homogeneous layers that would protect pipe from corrosion Scale can be soft or porous and is extremely irregular. Rust can still happen under conditions that agree with to the formation of hard-water scale or perhaps when hard-water scale is already present.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical compound that serves as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water instead of building up on surface areas. However, if they stay in one place for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the buildup could still take place.</p>

The amount of minerals liquified in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>
