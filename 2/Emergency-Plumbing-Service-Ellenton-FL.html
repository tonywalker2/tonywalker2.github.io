<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and elsewhere during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and avenues, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
