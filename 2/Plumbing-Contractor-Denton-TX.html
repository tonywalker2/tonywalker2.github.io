Functions such as these add cost, and aren't that effective. Your best technique is to get the water heater with the 12 year warranty. Chlorinated Polyvinylchloride Piping (CPVC) piping materials cost from $0.40 to $1.56 per direct foot.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and determine the cause of the issue. The line was plainly deteriorating; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line could collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
