Nevertheless, it adds a fair amount of functionality to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a fairly small cylindrical device installed under the kitchen drain. When switched on, your disposal system pulls down wastewater and any material debris by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such debris. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly flow into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
