<p>Another typical misperception is that calcium-carbonate scale is an efficient form of deterioration control. There is a lack of scientific proof supporting this claim, however. Scale does not form in uniform homogeneous layers that would safeguard pipe from deterioration Scale can be porous or soft and is extremely irregular. Rust can still occur under conditions that are favorable to the development of hard-water scale or even when hard-water scale is currently present.</p>
<p>However, if the clog is further down the sewer line, requiring unique equipment to be generated, it will cost more, specifically if flooring needs to be pulled up or the toilet needs to be rebuilt. If you have a manual snake, you can attempt to break up the clog yourself first prior to calling a professional.
