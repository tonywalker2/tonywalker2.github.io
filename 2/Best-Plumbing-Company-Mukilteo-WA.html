<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
