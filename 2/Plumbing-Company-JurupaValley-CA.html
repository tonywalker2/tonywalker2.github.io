<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>This is the classic concern that many property owners ask themselves. Is it better to repair their pipes or repipe them and begin fresh? The answer is entirely based on your distinct situation.
