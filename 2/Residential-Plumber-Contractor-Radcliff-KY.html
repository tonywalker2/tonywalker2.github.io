<p>When the end user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water flows in the typical direction from the supplier, downstream to fill the user's need. The circulation of water pushes the spring-loaded check valves open. The stress of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure difference in the Zone of Minimized Pressure. This distinction in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water streams in the regular instructions.</p>
<p>Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked units and need fewer repairs gradually. Sanford & Boy plumbing offers sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding locations.
