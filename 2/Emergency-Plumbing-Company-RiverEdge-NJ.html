Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
