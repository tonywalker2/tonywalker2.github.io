<p>When the components are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage turned off stays in the closed position.

Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial areas in the assembly.
