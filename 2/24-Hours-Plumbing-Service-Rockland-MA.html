<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and elsewhere throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and channels, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
