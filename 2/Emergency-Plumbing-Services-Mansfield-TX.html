<p>Difficult water causes a higher risk of lime scale deposits in household water systems. Due to this lime scale accumulation, pipes are blocked and the efficiency of hot boilers and tanks is decreased. This increases the cost of domestic water heating by about fifteen to twenty percent. Dark Blue = Supply-side pressure (for example, 100 psi) pushes against the # 1 check and also fills the area on the "high pressure" side of the Relief Valve diaphram, pressing it closed.</p>

We will help you prevent the pitfalls of incorrect sink installation, making sure that your brand-new sink fits in the area you have, all pipes are practical, caulking is tight, and the sink looks and works terrific.</p>
