Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
