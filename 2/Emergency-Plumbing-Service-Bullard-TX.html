<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, however if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can posture problems.</p>
