<h3>Reverse Osmosis Systems in Hesperia California</h2>
<p>If the baking soda and white vinegar approach does not work, follow with a plunger. Fill the sink with water and vigorously plunge up and down for several minutes to remove the clog. When dealing with a double bowl kitchen sink, stuff the other opening with a rag, which helps use extra pressure to the clog. For blockages that occur even more down the pipe, use a cable auger or plumber's snake. These tools are made of long, versatile steel cable wound around a spool with a hand crank. To use a cable auger, eliminate the horizontal P-trap below the sink, making certain it is not clogged before proceeding. Take out 18 inches of cable at a time, crank the handle in a clockwise direction and push the auger forward at the very same time. Repeat the process, pulling out an extra 18 inches up until you break through the clog. In some cases loose debris will settle into a new blockage. Follow with a plunger, if needed.</p>
