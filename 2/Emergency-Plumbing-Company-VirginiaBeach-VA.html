<h3>Plumbing Services Around VirginiaBeach VA</h3>
<p>Plumbing and piping technology has actually improved over the last thirty years. Copper has actually been the preferred option to replace galvanized iron pipes (which used to be considered really strong, but they were found to crack under pressure and tend to wear away within a couple of years). Today, the majority of quality contractors use PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the inside of the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Often during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin areas leak immediately and in some cases those leakages come days or weeks later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up requiring to be correctly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
