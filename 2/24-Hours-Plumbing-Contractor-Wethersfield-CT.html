<p>Water softeners leaks are mainly triggered because of a problem at the point of installation or because of maintenance. When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly.

A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal may likewise be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration procedures. A used water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is likely cracked and just needs to be changed.</p>
