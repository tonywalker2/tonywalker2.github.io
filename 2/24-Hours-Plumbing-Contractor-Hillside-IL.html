<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
