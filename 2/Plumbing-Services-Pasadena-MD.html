<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Pasadena MD</h3>
<p>Over the years, material and debris collect in your drains. Most of these products wash away through the drain into your sewer line or septic system. However, some products tend to stay with the pipe wall and develop a clog. A few of the most typical contributors to clogged drains include hair and skin flakes from the bath or shower, littles food, grease, oil and minerals such as magnesium and calcium that have actually sped up from the water. These materials adhere to the side of the pipe wall and harden gradually, producing a stubborn clog that is frequently difficult to remove. Quality drain cleaning company can assist you return on track.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
