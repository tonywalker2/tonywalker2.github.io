<p>IRWD is dedicated to providing safe, high quality water to clients. Our substantial water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water delivered to our consumers is kept devoid of harmful impurities. A vital part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to devices consisting of a nonpotable compound, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination might occur when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating and cooling system, into the drinkable water system. This can occur through a procedure known as backflow.</p>
<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
