Owners and boards of structures that are released an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer must submit strategies with the DEP within thirty days. If the DEP has not gotten accreditation from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being installed within that time, a Notification of Infraction will be sent. Violators will be liable for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 released by the Environmental protection Board (ECB).
