<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is normal in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
