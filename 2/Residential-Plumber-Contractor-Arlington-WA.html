<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and expect the very best is common in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
