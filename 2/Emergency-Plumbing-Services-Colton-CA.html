After we have cleaned the body, and the fixed parts are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or particles. This can be tricky, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is very important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be used to assure the line is appropriately flushed.</p>
