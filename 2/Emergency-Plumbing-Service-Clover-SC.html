<p>A waste disposal unit need to not leak. When this happens, it typically suggests wear and tear which is a reasonable indication that its time is up.

<p>After getting here after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen tossed up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together however declared they would not take obligation if it leaked now because of some unspecified curiosity in how my sink was put together. After they gave me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, considering that I never want to see this company again.</p>
