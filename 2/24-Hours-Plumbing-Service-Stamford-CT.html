Remember to take precautions when dealing with gas home appliances, use the aforementioned signs to determine possible leaks, and call a plumber to have your gas lines regularly kept and examined.</p>
<p>Energy Effectiveness. Selecting a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star ranking is suggested. The energy effectiveness of a storage water heater is suggested by its Energy Element (EF). The more effective the hot water heater the greater the EF rating.
