Even if you take great care of your drains by covering them and avoiding pouring any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, often clogs are inescapable. If you have a clogged drain, it is exceptionally important that you do not try to unclog it yourself because this might potentially cause a big leak and more pricey repairs.</p>
