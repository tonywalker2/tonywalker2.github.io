<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Regrettably, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these issues.</p>

<h3>Fixing A Clogged Toilet at Lyman SC</h3>
<p>Our licensed plumbing technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by connecting a hose to drain the tank to an ideal drain. Flushing the water heating tank must be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner may offer a fast fix in the short term, it can cause even more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run. A good location to start searching for the leaking kitchen sink plumbing system is underneath the puddle of water or where you appear to feel the moisture most.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, handling plumbing problems becomes part of home ownership. When the time comes, you need skilled professionals that you can depend on to finish the job right. At Waldrop Plumbing - Heating - Air, we have 50 years of experience providing repiping in Greenville, SC and Spartanburg Counties. From setting up brand-new pipes in a house addition to whole-house repiping, we are equipped to finish the task to your satisfaction.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest much more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
