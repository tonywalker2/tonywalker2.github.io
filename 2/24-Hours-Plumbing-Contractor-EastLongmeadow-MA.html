<h3>Blocked Drains in EastLongmeadow MA - Various Tools Used</h3>
<p>Besides water dripping and the periodic creak, your pipes should not be making any odd noises, specifically not ones loud enough to keep you up in the evening. If your pipes are rattling, clanking, banging or making other obnoxious sounds, that's a guaranteed indication of a larger problem. Have your pipes checked as soon as possible so you don't end up with a major leak.</p>
<p>When the water softening does not happen it could also suggest softener malfunction, or a problem with the salt that is used.
