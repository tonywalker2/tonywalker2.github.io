<p>Sewer lines can stop working for a variety of reasons, consisting of bad soil conditions, clogs from grease and gunk, and rust. Even trees and bushes can trigger problems for sewer lines, particularly in older areas where clay pipe might have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be doubly compounded if pipes have actually been allowed to freeze.</p>
<p>When the information collected from the field test suggests the assembly has broken down in its efficiency below the developed minimum basic, backflow preventers need to only be fixed. The test treatment is a diagnostic evaluation of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if necessary, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This means the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
