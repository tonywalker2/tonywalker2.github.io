This causes cracks in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been found to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these concerns.</p>
