<p>As an IMPORTANT SERVICES BUSINESS, we remain Available and open to assist with any of your plumbing, drain, heating, cooling or electrical needs. The garbage disposal is among the most misused appliances in the whole house.

When wet, coffee premises are minimized to a thick, heavily packed wad of mush, which can clog drain lines and lead to major plumbing problems.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be triggered due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the issue. You may have to check out utilizing a high pressure water supply to remove the clog. This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the intensity of the clog. There are two basic piping materials used by plumbing experts. PEX and copper both use various benefits and benefits such as eliminating the metallic taste from your water.</p>
