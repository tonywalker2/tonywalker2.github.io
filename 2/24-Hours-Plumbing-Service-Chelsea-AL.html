<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Chelsea AL</h3>
<p>Corrosion: The most typical issue is rust in the tank and pipes that link to your hot water heater. This is specifically true if you have untreated hard water, which includes extreme minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the product in time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another component that is causing the corrosion, you will eventually experience a leak in your water heater that is difficult to repair. Leakages frequently mean a new unit replacement is in order.</p>
<p>Energy Efficiency. Choosing a tank with at least 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star score is recommended. The energy efficiency of a storage hot water heater is shown by its Energy Element (EF). The more efficient the water heater the higher the EF score. However, just because a water heater has a higher EF worth, it doesn't always indicate it will have lower operating costs. You also have to consider the fuel source.</p>
