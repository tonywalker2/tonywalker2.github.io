<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and in other places during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
