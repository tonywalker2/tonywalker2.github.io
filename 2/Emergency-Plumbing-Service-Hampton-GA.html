<p>Both methods are extremely efficient and reducing waste and clearing it. The greatest difference is in timing. With a batch disposal, you fill the unit, cover it, then turn it on.

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers carry just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
