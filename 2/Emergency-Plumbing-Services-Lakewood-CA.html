<p>While water temperature fluctuation could be credited to your hot water heater, the plumbing pipes might also be the main offender. It's probably your water heater that needs to be examined if your water turns from hot to cold in an instant.

<p>There are numerous products used in re-piping, in water supply re-piping a few of the products are metal and perhaps some plastic pipes. The metal pipes are galvanized steel or brass, copper, and iron. The plastic pipes are Poly Vinyl Chloride PVC, Chlorine Poly Vinyl Chloride CPVC, Poly Ethylene PE, Polybutylene PB, and Kitec. Most of these plastic pipe systems will end in suits. Part of the problem is with the fittings that are typically inexpensively made with little quality assurance by a verity of overseas companies. Plastic pipes also have doubtful joining methods. Plastic pipes are glued, crimped, and banded. When plastic pipes blow a joint they blow apart and lead to water damage. Plastics end up being breakable with age and heat. There are also concerns about the molecular structure of plastics and the resins from which they are made.</p>
