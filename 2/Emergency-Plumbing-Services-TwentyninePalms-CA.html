<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is typical in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
