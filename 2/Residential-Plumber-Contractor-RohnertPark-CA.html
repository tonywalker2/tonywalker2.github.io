<h3>Most Effective Drain Cleaning Methods RohnertPark CA</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
