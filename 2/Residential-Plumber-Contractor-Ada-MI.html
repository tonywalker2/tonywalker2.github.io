But if your toilet is displaying any of the following indications, it might be time to replace it. We examine backflow requirements for services on a specific basis when a water account is developed. After eliminating standing water from the sink, put about 1/2 cup of salt down the drain before you gather the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and after that flush with warm water to clear the mix.</p>
<p>However, you also need to think about the age of your system. If your system is getting near to ten years old, it's normally not smart to pay for repairs if they deserve more than 50 percent of the cost of a new unit.
