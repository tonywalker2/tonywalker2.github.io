<h3>How To Deal With A Plumbing Emergency Sterling MA</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to address tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>If you see rust just in your warm water, then check the status of your hot water heater's anode rod. If you've never ever done this on your own, you may need a professional to do this. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is probably originating from the inside of your hot water heater. Replace your hot water heater as quickly as possible if this holds true. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your hot and cold water taps, you probably have worn away piping.</p>
