<p>Frequent leakages: Leaks originating from your hot water heater are never ever a great sign. If your water heater has frequent leakages or is continuously needing repairs, it is likely more cost-efficient to replace the entire unit. A backflow preventer is a device that's installed on your home's pipes that permits water to stream in one direction but never in the opposite direction. Its sole task is to avoid drinking water from being infected due to backflow.</p>

A licensed plumber can not just discover that cause of the problem but securely repair or replace your main sewer line if required.
