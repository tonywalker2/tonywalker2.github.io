<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>

Whether tree roots have actually made their method into your pipes or you flushed something you should not have, a clogged toilet is never an enjoyable experience.
