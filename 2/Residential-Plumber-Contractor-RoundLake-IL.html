<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are installed in areas where water could cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
