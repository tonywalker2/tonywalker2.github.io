<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They instantly cleared the initial clog, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
