<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and in other places throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and conduits, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>

<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can become infected. If allowed to return to the water system, there is capacity for the contaminated water to end up being a health threat. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for efficiency, along with examined every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
