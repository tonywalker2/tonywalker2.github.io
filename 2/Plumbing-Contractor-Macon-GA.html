<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Macon GA</h3>
<p>Reach for a common household plunger if these combinations aren't effective in unclogging your sink. If you have a double sink, first seal off the second side with a wet fabric or a stopper. You'll need to create a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you mean to plunge with enough water to cover the bell of the plunger. Place the plunger strongly over the drain and plunge intensely a number of times. Remove the plunger and flush the drain well with warm water when you hear the suction clear the clog.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
