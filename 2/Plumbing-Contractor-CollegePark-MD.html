<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is normal in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace.

The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
