<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct impact on your security, convenience, comfort, and dependability than your plumbing system. This is incredibly important! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system. Current guidelines limit the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris accumulating in cast iron drain lines.

<p>Another choice is to utilize salt pellets in the brine tank, but then install a reverse-osmosis water filter at the kitchen sink. The filter will get rid of salt from the water, which you can utilize for drinking and cooking. From multi-tank systems powered by the energy of moving water to a more standard technique, Kinetico covers all your options. Your local Kinetico water specialist will work with you to pick the water softener that's right for you.</p>
