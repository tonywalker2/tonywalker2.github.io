<p>Another choice is to utilize salt pellets in the brine tank, but then install a reverse-osmosis water filter at the kitchen sink. The filter will get rid of salt from the water, which you can utilize for drinking and cooking.

Your local Kinetico water specialist will work with you to pick the water softener that's right for you.</p>
