<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
