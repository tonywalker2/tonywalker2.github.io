<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed successful, Sam Blanc designed and constructed a smaller sized design that ran on the same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise constructed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and local sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might likewise thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
