Unlike a drip leg, the flow of the gas is altered to eliminate any sediment. A sediment trap might be included in a drip leg install. The City requires backflow prevention gadgets to be installed anywhere there exists a connection that could allow tainted water into the City system or personal plumbing. These gadgets go through testing by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In many cases, they go through regular tests later, also.</p>
