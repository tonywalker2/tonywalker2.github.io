Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
