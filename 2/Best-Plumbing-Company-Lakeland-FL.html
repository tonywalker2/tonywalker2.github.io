<p>2. Demand-initiated softeners regenerate when they sense their softening capability is low as figured out by a predetermined number gone into by the user. The preset number represents the quantity of time in between each regeneration. For example, a lower picked number means your softener will regenerate less typically.

Demand-initiated softeners are more popular and efficient than time-initiated softeners.</p>
