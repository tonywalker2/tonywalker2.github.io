<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
