<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair Tips and Techniques at EastHanover NJ</h3>
<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are many factors that accelerate deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For many years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that accelerate rust Likewise, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable type of corrosion control. Therefore, considering all these elements, in addition to results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
