<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, but if you have actually been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
