To find an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You may not find an identical match, however chances are you'll find among the exact same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>

<p>During regular operation, the pressure between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of reduced pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is developed to open and discharge water to the outside if either check valve must leak. An RPZ will regularly discharge small amounts of water due to change in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be installed in areas that are not subject to water damage and allow appropriate drainage.</p>
