<p>When completion user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water flows in the normal direction from the provider, downstream to fill the user's need. The circulation of water pushes the spring-loaded check valves open. The tension of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure distinction in the Zone of Reduced Pressure.
