<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services SunCityWest AZ</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
