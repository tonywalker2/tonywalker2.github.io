<p>The simplest service may appear to be just overlooking the issue or utilizing a do it yourself chemical solution. Nevertheless, this is a short-lived fix and may cause more damage.

<p>Renovation plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this method, you understand the turnkey cost entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
