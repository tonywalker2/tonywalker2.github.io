You might not discover an identical match, but opportunities are you'll find one of the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>

The very best method to lower build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of when a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is specifically hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>
