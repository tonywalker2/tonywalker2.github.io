Every house must have carbon monoxide detectors installed at the proper places. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family houses to have both smoke and carbon monoxide gas detectors. They are generally sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all new installations must have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you may have to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug kit that I bought individually from the disposal unit.
