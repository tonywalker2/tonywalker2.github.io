Gas tank systems utilize almost 50% less energy, costing less to run, than the electrical range. However, they cost a bit more than electric designs. They likewise include a temperature and pressure-release valve that opens when either temperature level or pressure exceeds pre-programmed levels. We supply gas hot water heater service, in addition to electrical hot water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Coast.</p>
