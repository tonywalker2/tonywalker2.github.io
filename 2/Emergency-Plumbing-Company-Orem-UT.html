The signal triggers the minerals to collaborate, forming clusters that eventually form steady crystals. These crystals do not hold on to surfaces like individual minerals would.</p>

<p>The source or area of a sewer issue identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (normally 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
