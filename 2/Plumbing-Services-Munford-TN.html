A permit is not needed for repairs which involve just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages offered modifications are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A common water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, broad brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a close-by drainpipe or drywell.</p>
