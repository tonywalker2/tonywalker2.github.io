<p>Even if you think you can handle it on your own, you probably do not have a camera suitable for identifying the reason for blockage around bends in your pipes. You may even have a drain snake handy, however when's the last time you utilized it-- and are you sure you're doing it right? Often the very best thing you can do for your home is call somebody with the right tools and knowledge to fix your problem quickly and efficiently.
