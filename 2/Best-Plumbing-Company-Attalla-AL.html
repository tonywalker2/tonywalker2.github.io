<p>Backflow preventers need to just be repaired when the information collected from the field test suggests the assembly has actually broken down in its performance listed below the established minimum standard. The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer need to be repaired or if necessary, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow.
