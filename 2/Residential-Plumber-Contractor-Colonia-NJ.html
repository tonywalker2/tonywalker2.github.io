<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and in other places during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and conduits, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
