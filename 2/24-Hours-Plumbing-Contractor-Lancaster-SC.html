<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were very responsive and timely to send me a quote which was very competitive. They were very professional and did an amazing job. I would certainly call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this staining just appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust most likely exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still an issue that needs to be handled immediately (you'll likely need a brand-new hot water heater) however not one that requires repiping.</p>
