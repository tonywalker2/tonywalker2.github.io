<p>Backflow preventers are crucial for producing a safe supply of water system. No matter which design you choose, all water softeners need to be effectively kept.

If not, slowly stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Also, fungi and germs also form mats in the resin that minimize its effectiveness. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these problems. Nevertheless, check out the maker's instructions before including any chemicals to the unit.</p>
