<p>Inside the home, inspect the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for drips or leaks. Examine below sinks to check for leaking pipes. Local plumber priced quote price of $400 to install plus cost of garbage disposal. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ happy I examined around. Under the sink, put a container or pan underneath the waste pipe, then use locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's waste pipe. To loosen up the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
<p>To get rid of the cord from the old disposer, utilize a screwdriver to get rid of the plate covering the electrical connections at the bottom of the system. Disconnect the wire nuts and pull the cable through the cover plate hole. For preventive maintenance, Larry & Sons uses annual checkups on your sewer and septic tanks. Our professionals carefully examine your whole drainage system with video camera pipe inspection to prevent future problems before they occur.
