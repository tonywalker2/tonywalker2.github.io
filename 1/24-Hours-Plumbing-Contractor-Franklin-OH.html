After they gave me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, given that I never ever wish to see this company again.</p>
