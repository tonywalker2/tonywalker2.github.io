We discover that houses 15 years or older who have actually never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing frequent and significant leakages, you might be in need of water line repiping. If you do have regular leakages, we find that repiping can in fact be the cheaper and much better long-term solution.</p>
