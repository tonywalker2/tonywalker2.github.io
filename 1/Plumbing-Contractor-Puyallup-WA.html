<p>Reach for a common household plunger if these mixes aren't successful in unclogging your sink. If you have a double sink, first seal the 2nd side with a wet fabric or a stopper. You'll need to develop a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you intend to plunge with enough water to cover the bell of the plunger. Place the plunger strongly over the drain and plunge strongly several times. When you hear the suction clear the clog, remove the plunger and flush the drain well with warm water.</p>
