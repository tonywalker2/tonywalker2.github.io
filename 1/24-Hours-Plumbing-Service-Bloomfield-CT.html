<p>During typical operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of decreased pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is developed to discharge and open water to the exterior. An RPZ will regularly discharge small amounts of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ must be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and permit adequate drainage.</p>
