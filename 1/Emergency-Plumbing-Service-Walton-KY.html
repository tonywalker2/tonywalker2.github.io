This can increase the amount of time needed to install the brand-new unit, therefore increasing expenses. This actually depends on what condition the rest of the pipes are in, and how hard the old system is to remove. Oftentimes, elimination will only include an additional $25 to $50 to the overall expenses, however in many cases the costs might be greater if extra pipes should also be changed.</p>
