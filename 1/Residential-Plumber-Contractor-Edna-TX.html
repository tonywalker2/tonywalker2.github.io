<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which designs are best for particular applications? Typically the type and installation requirements are spelled out by local statutes and ecological policies. Local building codes for instance will require a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air gap between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any possible siphon before it can occur, avoiding polluting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more complex and advanced backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical gadgets installed to prevent backflow range from the reasonably simple to the complicated and very sophisticated.</p>
