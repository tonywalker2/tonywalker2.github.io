When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement.

We find that repiping can really be the less expensive and much better long-term service if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
