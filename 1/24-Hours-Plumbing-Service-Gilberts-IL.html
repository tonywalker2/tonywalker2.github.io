<p>Many houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition security. As the external coating of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
