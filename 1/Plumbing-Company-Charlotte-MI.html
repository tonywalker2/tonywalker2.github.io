<p>Rust is an intricate phenomenon and there are many elements that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that speed up rust Also, there is a lack of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective form of rust control. Hence, considering all these elements, along with results from research studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>

In the house shops, a lot of Badger 5 disposals can be bought for about $99-150. With Bill Howe's extra service warranty, with installation, clients are looking at approximately $325.
