<p>Rust is a complicated phenomenon and there are numerous elements that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it crucial to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that accelerate deterioration Also, there is a lack of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable kind of rust control. Thus, considering all these factors, as well as arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that a correctly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
