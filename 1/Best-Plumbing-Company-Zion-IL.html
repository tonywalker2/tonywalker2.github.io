<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the cause of the issue.

Even worse, the line might collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
