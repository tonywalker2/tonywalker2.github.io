A hissing noise leaving nearby gas lines is indicative of a big gas leak. You should follow safety precautions and address the leak instantly if you hear the noise of air (or gas) forcibly leaking out of a pipe.</p>
<p>Because of unfavorable or reduced pressure in the supply side of the water system, back siphonage occurs when water is drawn or pulled backwards. Infected water can be pulled into the supply line from sprinklers or other emitters if the watering line does not have a backflow preventer at the cross-connection. If your sewer lines are having problems in the Denver area, contact Rooter66 Plumbing & Drain Cleaning at 303-596-0265.

<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that controls water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that ranges from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't installed properly, you might experience an often or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in wasted water.</p>
