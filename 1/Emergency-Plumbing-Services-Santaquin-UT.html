<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
