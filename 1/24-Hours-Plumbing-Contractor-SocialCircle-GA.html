<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service SocialCircle GA</h3>

<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
