<p>In water distribution systems, water is usually kept at a considerable pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might stop working or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
