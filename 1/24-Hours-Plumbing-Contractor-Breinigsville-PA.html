Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure.
