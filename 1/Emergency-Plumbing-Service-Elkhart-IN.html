A typical protective device called a backflow preventer (BFP) can be set up within the plumbing system to effectively shut-off the home or service from the street sewer system during sewage back-ups.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, heater, and dishwasher, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these small deposits are safe, but gradually they develop and ultimately clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can considerably restrict the water circulation, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
