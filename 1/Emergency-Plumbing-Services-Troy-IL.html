<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
