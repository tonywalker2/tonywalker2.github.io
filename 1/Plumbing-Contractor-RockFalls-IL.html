<p>To determine which toilet valve is triggering the problem, look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into the tube, there's an issue with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing entirely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so beautiful inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water stains and rust. However do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
