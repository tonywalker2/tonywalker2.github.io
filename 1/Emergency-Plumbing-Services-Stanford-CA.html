<p>Examples of backflow conditions include backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can save your plumbing system from unnecessary blockages further down the water lines. In some instances, resins can not be washed of contaminants and will need to be changed. (This must not be the case if the resin is regularly regrowed and maintained.) Consult your water softener dealership for info on resin replacement.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
