<p>When selecting the appropriate system security there are several factors to consider we need to look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be looked at on an individual basis as an unique stand-alone system.

<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually typically been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment.

The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers personal choice not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a considerable one.</p>
