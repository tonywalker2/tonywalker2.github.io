<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is typical in our market and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
