To avoid corrosion from rust, tank are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod safeguards the tank by bring in damaging products. By having the anode rod examined routinely and replaced as needed, you can double the life of your water heater.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just put some media inside a tank and expect the best is normal in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can attain this.</p>
