<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Monument CO</h3>
<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has space to hold on to positive ions. The fresh media begins by holding on to the weaker charged salt ions. As difficult water passes through your water softener tank, the stronger charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Because the firmness minerals have a higher favorable charge than the salt, they will knock the sodium ions off and take their location.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
