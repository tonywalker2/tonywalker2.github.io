When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can become polluted. There is capacity for the polluted water to end up being a health hazard if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, in addition to inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
