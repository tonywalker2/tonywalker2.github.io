<p>To identify which toilet valve is causing the problem, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overflowing into television, there's an issue with the toilet fill valve.

That sluggish, constant outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing completely. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water discolorations and corrosion.
