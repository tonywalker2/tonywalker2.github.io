<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most common and devastating water problems: difficult water.  Difficult water wreaks havoc on the modern home. Scale develops in your pipes, clogging them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale drastically shortens the life expectancy of appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice devices. Hard water destroys hot water appliances. The higher the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will strengthen and harden into strong deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>
