<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>The drains in the typical house get consistent usage. Hair, food scraps, soap scum, and other particles can gradually develop gradually. The drain will slowly slow until it ends up being entirely clogged. Chemical drain cleaners sold in stores have restricted effectiveness. Although the drain might appear to clear initially, the outcome is frequently short-term and the clog soon returns. Using these chemicals often can cause damage to your plumbing pipes.</p>
<p>A double check backflow preventer includes two spring-loaded check assemblies to prevent back and back siphonage pressure on non-health risk (low danger) systems. Unscrew the coupling nut that connects the supply line. If the toilet valve turns inside the toilet tank, hold its base with a locking pliers. Suggestion: Toss a towel on the floor below to capture water that will drain from the line.</p>
