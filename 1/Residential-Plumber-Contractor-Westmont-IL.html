<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
