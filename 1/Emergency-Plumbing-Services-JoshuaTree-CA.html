<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is normal in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately working together that you can attain this.</p>
