Fire protection system are designed to match the danger that exists in the areas they are set up in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be very different, we need to comprehend that the fire security system for any installation needs to be created and set up to meet that specific hazard or need. An aircraft hangar will need an extremely different fire protection system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow protection requirements for these two examples would likewise differ significantly.</p>
