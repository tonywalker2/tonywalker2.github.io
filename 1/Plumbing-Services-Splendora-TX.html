<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber Splendora TX</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that are subject to fouling, use or tiredness. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. Therefore, all backflow preventers need to be checked occasionally to ensure they are operating appropriately. A visual check of air gaps is sufficient, however mechanical backflow preventers have to be evaluated with appropriately calibrated gauge equipment.</p>
