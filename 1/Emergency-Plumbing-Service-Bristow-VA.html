<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>

<p>Softeners generally eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently described as 'solidity minerals'.
