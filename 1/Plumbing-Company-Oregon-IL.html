By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to offer some kind of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're dealing with installing it.

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the building; additional, more considerable costs can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for citizens. A PE or RA can help determine if setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss.</p>
