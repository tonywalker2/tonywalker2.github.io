When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can become infected. If enabled to re-enter the water system, there is potential for the infected water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for efficiency, in addition to examined annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
