Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
