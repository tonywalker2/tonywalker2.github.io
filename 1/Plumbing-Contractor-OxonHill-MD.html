<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.

<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leaks happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these problems.</p>
