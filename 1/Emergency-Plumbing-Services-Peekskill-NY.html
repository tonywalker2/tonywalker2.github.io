To make it soft, you need to remove the minerals. That's the main distinction in between soft and difficult water The existence of the minerals in the water can reveal itself in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may need to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug kit that I bought separately from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>If you're like most people, you have actually never ever even considered it, but flushing your hot water heater can help it last longer and could save you money on energy costs by restoring the efficiency of the water heater. Your water heater ought to be flushed when a year. It may have up to eight inches of sediment at the bottom of the tank if you have a 15‐year‐old water heater that's never been flushed. That indicates 8 less inches of hot water, not to mention the reality that your faucet water is being heated up in a tank with calcium, scale, rust, dirt, iron, and sulfuric‐smelling bacteria.</p>
