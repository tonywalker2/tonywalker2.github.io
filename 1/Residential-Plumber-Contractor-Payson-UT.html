<p>Other than water trickling and the occasional creak, your pipes must not be making any odd noises, particularly not ones loud enough to keep you up in the evening. If your pipes are rattling, clanking, banging or making other obnoxious noises, that's a proven indication of a larger issue. Have your pipes inspected as soon as possible so you don't wind up with a major leak.</p>
