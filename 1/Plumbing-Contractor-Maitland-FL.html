<h3>Helpful Tips For Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Maitland FL</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
