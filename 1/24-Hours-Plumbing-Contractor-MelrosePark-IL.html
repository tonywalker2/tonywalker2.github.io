Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>

If you have kids, advise them to avoid hanging on any noticeable pipelines or having fun with the outdoor gas meter. Hanging on a pipeline may trigger it to come loose or break, launching gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter should be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly available in an emergency.</p>
