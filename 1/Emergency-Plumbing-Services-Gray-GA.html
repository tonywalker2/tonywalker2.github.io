<p>Surprise water leaks are typically difficult and have Possibly Serious Effects. Changing your flapper might require somewhat different actions than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To discover an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, but chances are you'll locate one of the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
