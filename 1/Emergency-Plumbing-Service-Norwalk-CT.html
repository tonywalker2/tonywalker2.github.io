I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
