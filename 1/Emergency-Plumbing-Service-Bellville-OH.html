<h3>Clogged Pipes in Bellville Ohio</h2>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
