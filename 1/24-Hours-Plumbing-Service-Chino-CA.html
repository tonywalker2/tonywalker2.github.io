<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
