Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization appropriately working together that you can attain this.</p>
