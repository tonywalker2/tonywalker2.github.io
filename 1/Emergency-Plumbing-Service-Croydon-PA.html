<p>Every water heater we install has actually been checked under the most extreme water temperature levels and was developed to last a very long time.

Performance and resilience are crucial elements of every water heater we sell. That's why citizens of Centreville, Fairfax, Herndon, Reston, Leesburg, and other parts of Northern Virginia have been using Service Specializeds for hot water heater installations for almost 40 years now.

<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this approach, you know the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
