<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing regular and major leaks, you could be in need of water line repiping. We discover that repiping can actually be the cheaper and better long-term option if you do have frequent leakages.</p>
