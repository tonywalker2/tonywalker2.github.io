<p>We concentrate on tub and shower replacement and full bathroom renovating at very competitive rates. Turn on the gas and inspect connections for leakages by brushing a 50-50 mixture of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mixture bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten up or reconnect joints that leak. When finished, wipe the joints dry. Call the plumbing inspector to check over your work. Follow the how-to advice that accompanies the pictures to ensure the connections are tight.</p>
<p>You want to conserve water. Older toilets use up to 7 gallons of water per flush and are much less water-efficient than more recent designs.
