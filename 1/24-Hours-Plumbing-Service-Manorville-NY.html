<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
