<p>Backflow preventers are important for producing a safe water system system. No matter which design you select, all water softeners need to be appropriately kept. The brine option need to be combined and stored in the brine tank. Routine clogging of the resin also requires special attention.

If not, gradually stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Likewise, germs and fungis likewise form mats in the resin that minimize its efficiency. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or occasionally cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these nuisances. Nevertheless, check out the manufacturer's guidelines before adding any chemicals to the unit.</p>
