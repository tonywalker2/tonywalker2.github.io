No, it is not a frequent occurrence, however it does occur more often than you believe! When you don't discover the water was off for a couple of minutes, frequently it happens at night. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
