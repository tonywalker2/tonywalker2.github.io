Make sure to compare water softeners based upon your home's water and your family's water usage. An authorized EcoWater Pro can identify your water and recommend the very best alternative for your home.</p>
<p>New homes constructed with copper pipes are specifically vulnerable to corrosive water conditions since the copper pipes have actually not had a possibility to end up being coated inside. As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a duration of 3 to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Many new homes are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
