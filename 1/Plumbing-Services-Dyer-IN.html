<p>No other room in a home contains as many pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. Whether you need electric, gas, or tankless hot water heater, we have the ideal one for your home.

A tankless water heater would be best if you are looking to save more energy and lower your water costs because it only warms water, as you use it not when you do not.</p>
<p>Another option is to utilize salt pellets in the salt water tank, but then install a reverse-osmosis water filter at the kitchen sink. The filter will eliminate salt from the water, which you can use for drinking and cooking. From multi-tank systems powered by the energy of moving water to a more traditional method, Kinetico covers all your choices. Your local Kinetico water specialist will work with you to pick the water softener that's right for you.</p>
