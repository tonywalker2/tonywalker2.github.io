<p>New England Pipe Remediation is the premier sewer repair supplier in the Northeast.

<p>A water softener works by using electrical charges to get rid of the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals carry favorable charges, so water softeners utilize salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you water with drinkable water, you are needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection.
