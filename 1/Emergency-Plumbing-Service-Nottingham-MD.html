<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Nottingham MD</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be required to be found on the water service line, within the building, or both places. After an initial inspection and testing of a newly set up backflow preventer, the water consumer is needed to have the backflow preventer evaluated on an annual basis.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This activates the disc to open, enabling air to enter the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
