<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has typically been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due mostly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening simply removes hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
<p>Softeners mainly eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are often described as 'firmness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they need to be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a huge red flag that something more major is wrong with them.</p>
<p>Standard tank-type water heaters consist of steel cylinders that are fed by a pipes that dips into a big storage tank. The water inside this tank is warmed up and then launched into the pipes of your home through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank includes the temperature level and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you surpass a pre-programmed level. You'll also discover a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control system outside for setting temperatures and managing the pilot-light valve.</p>
