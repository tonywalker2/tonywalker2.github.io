<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the reason for the problem. The line was clearly degrading; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
