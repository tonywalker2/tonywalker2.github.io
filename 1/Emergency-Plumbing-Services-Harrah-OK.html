<p>In many cases, our technicians will advise that you replace your hot water heater instead of invest in repairs. This is generally When the water heater is more than 10 years old or the cost of repairs would total more than half the cost of a whole new system, the case. In some cases a troublesome toilet just needs a small adjustment and life is back to regular. That is why we provide a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) change the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) carry out a color test.</p>
<p>If you have delicate skin, eczema, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis or dry winter itch it's a great idea to switch a precipitating water softener for a non-precipitating water softener.

<p>The Last Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that controls water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't set up appropriately, you may experience a frequently or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in lost water.</p>
