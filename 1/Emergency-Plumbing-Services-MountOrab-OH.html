<p>Both approaches are highly efficient and minimizing waste and clearing it. The biggest distinction is in timing. With a batch disposal, you fill the unit, cover it, then turn it on. If it's completely complete, it will take a bit to clear through the waste, and if you find you forgot something, you need to wait till it's done to put the brand-new waste in.</p>
<p>Then attach the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if relevant). If your system is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make certain your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the new unit in. While it's not likely that having a disposal start up while your head is pushed versus it will cause decapitation, it might scare a couple of years off your life.
