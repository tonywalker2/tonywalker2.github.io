That sluggish, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing entirely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water stains and rust. But do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
