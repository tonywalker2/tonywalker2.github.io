Carrying occurs when the inbound tough water follows a narrow course through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened. If you have actually ever noticed that the busier your business is, the much better your cleaning agent works, the culprit could be a large softener.</p>
<p>You wish to conserve water. Older toilets use up to seven gallons of water per flush and are much less water-efficient than more recent designs. U.S. Epa's WaterSense toilets use less than 1.6 gallons per flush. Replacing your toilet with a new design can save countless gallons of water - decreasing your utility expenses and helping the environment.</p>
