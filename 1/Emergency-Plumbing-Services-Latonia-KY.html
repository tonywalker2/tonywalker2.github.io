<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Latonia KY</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
