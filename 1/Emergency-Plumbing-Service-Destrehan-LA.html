No, it is not a frequent occurrence, however it does happen more often than you believe! Often it happens during the night when you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or link a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction projects quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>For RPZ gadgets, drainage capacity will be sized to accommodate both periodic discharges and a devastating failure of the relief valve.
