<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
