<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
