If your house was developed before the 1970s, we highly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to check your house's plumbing and inspect if there are areas that need repiping. Chances are that your house might need extensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can function at optimum rates if your home was built decades before that.</p>
