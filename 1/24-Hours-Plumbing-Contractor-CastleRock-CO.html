<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the structure; additional, more significant costs can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for locals. If setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and determine the reason for the problem. The line was clearly weakening; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line could collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
