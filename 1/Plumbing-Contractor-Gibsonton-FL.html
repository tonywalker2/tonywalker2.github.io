<p>Poorly installed gas lines result in gas leakages. Gas leaks are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself project. The gas lines have to be adjusted to the ideal levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy states that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home."
