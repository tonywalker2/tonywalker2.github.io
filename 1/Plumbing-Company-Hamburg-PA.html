<p>As explained previously in the post, carbon monoxide is completely odorless and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide gas detector. Every house should have carbon monoxide gas detectors installed at the appropriate places. In California, it is a requirement for all multi-family and single homes to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are normally offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all new setups must have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
<p>In addition to the garbage disposal unit, there are a variety of upgrades and parts that you might need to take into consideration when weighing the waste disposal unit installation cost. For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, lower or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
