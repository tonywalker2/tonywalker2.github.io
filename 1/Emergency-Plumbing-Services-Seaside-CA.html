Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
