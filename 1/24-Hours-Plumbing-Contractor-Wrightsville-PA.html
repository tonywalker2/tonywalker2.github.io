The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from brief lengths of wood.
