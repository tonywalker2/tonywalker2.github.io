It is helpful to use pressure on the flange from above using a second set of hands or a heavy item. This will keep the flange in location while connecting the fastening system below. Make sure the plumber's putty is noticeably oozing beyond the edge of the flange all around (Image 2). When a total seal has formed, get rid of the excess putty with a rag.</p>
