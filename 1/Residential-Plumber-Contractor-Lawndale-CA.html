<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Lawndale CA</h3>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line obstructions are not something a homeowner can fix. This type of clog requires a professional plumber or drain professional to utilize a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this kind of camera to repair the drain and identify issue. If you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is especially helpful in finding an issue.</p>

After your brand-new hot water heater is set up, your service company will tidy up the area, remove your old system and provide details on how to keep your new water heater.

<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Lawndale CA?</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally maintained at a significant pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might stop working or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might enable infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
