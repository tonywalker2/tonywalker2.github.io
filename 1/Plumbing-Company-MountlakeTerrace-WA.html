Mr. Singh did at least 3 efforts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his understanding and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the debris decreased the freshly cleaned main drain. By adding perseverence and persistence the job was done to my total satisfaction.</p>
