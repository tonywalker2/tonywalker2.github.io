That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>It's pretty typical for debris to end up being flushed down our drains. Think about how often food particles, cooking oil and hair ends up in our showers and sinks. After adequate time, these items might build up into blockages, which can obstruct the circulation of water throughout a house. This can result in several problems, from foul stenches to water leaks and burst pipes.</p>

<p>DCVs are specifically designed to avoid backflow in fire sprinkler systems.

<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that manages water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't set up appropriately, you may experience an often or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in wasted water.</p>
