<p>Frequent leakages: Leakages originating from your hot water heater are never an excellent sign. If your water heater has frequent leaks or is constantly requiring repairs, it is likely more cost-effective to replace the whole unit. A backflow preventer is a device that's installed on your house's pipes that permits water to stream in one direction but never ever in the opposite direction. Its sole job is to avoid drinking water from being contaminated due to backflow.</p>
<p>It might be time to get it replaced if your water heater has actually needed multiple repairs over the last few years. An excellent guideline for water heaters is this: due to the fact that the life expectancy of the typical hot water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. If the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your hot water heater.</p>
