After we have cleaned the body, and the repaired elements are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or debris. This can be challenging, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system needs to be utilized to guarantee the line is effectively flushed.</p>
