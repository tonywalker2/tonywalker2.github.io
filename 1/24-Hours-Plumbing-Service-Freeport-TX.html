<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back against the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for efficiency, in addition to inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
