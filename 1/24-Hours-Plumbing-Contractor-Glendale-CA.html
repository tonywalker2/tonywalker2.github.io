<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
