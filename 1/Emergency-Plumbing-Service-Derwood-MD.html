<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, but if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can posture problems.</p>

However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models.
