<p>Understand that softened water contains trace quantities of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water consists of about the very same amount of salt as a piece of bread.

If this does not work, you might need to replace one of your toilet's parts, typically the flapper. There might also be an issue with the chain connected to the flapper or the float ball.
