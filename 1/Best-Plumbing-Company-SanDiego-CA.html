<p>Understand that softened water contains trace quantities of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water consists of about the very same amount of salt as a piece of bread.

If this does not work, you might need to replace one of your toilet's parts, typically the flapper. There might also be an issue with the chain connected to the flapper or the float ball. A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>

I would certainly call them once again for my plumbing requires. Now, if this discoloration only appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust probably exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes.

Depending upon the water source, you might have to filter turbid water or disinfect bacteria-laden water-all prior to it even reaches the softening system. Lastly, if you own a septic tank, you must think about the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth.
