<p>New houses developed with copper pipes are particularly susceptible to destructive water conditions due to the fact that the copper pipes have actually not had an opportunity to become layered within. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a duration of 3 to five months after tenancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Lots of brand-new homes are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
