It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be gotten rid of from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
