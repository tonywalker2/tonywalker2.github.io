<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services LakeSaintLouis MO</h3>
<p>The appearance of your kitchen sink or bathroom sink can impact the total appearance of your house. Many property owners purchase long lasting and beautiful granite countertops, marble countertops, quartz counter tops, and more due to the fact that they believe these are extremely durable and would last for many years. This is in fact real. In truth, countertops made from stone even add to the value of your property. However, you must understand that even if little maintenance is required and possible sealing is required every few years or so, unforeseen damages can still happen.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
