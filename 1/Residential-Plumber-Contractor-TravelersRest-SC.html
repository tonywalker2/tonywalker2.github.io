<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service TravelersRest SC</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
