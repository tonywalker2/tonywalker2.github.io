<p>If you're living in an old home that's never been refurbished, you may be dealing with frequent plumbing problems. Even if you don't have significant problems, it's wise to repipe your home to safeguard your residential or commercial property and avoid more substantial problems in the future. Here are indications stating you need a repipe company.</p>
<p>In most cases, when you have a clogged drain or toilet, an auger is used to unclog the pipe and get rid of the particles. Depending upon the seriousness of the clog, or how far into your sewer pipe the clog is located, a high powered auger might be required.

<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
