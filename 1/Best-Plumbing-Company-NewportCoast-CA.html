Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
