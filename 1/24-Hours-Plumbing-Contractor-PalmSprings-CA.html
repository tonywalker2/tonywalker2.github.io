<p>In general, toilets are quite simple to operate and repair. Nearly any part can be eliminated and changed reasonably quickly and rapidly The flipside of the toilet's low maintenance nature is, when it has an issue, the stakes are high. Harmed toilets can do some genuinely extensive, pricey, and ... stinky damage to a house. When something fails, and your kitchen sink draws back up, your toilet won't flush, or you can't shower, you need for professional assistance right now. That's where High 5 Plumbing can be found in.

<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey cost entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
