<p>After showing up after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after among the two gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together however declared they wouldn't take responsibility if it dripped now since of some undefined quirks in how my sink was put together. After they gave me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, because I never ever wish to see this company once again.</p>
