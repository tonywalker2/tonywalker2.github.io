<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services MerrittIsland FL</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be required to be found on the water service line, within the structure, or both areas. After a preliminary inspection and testing of a freshly set up backflow preventer, the water consumer is required to have the backflow preventer tested on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- basically two layers of protection. The device permits water to press the check valves open when water is entering into the building, however closes them shut when water tries to go the wrong way. There are two different kinds of testable backflow prevention devices that are frequently defined-- a lowered pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device.
