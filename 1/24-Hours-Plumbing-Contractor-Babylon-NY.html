<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer system calculates the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth instantly starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regeneration normally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
