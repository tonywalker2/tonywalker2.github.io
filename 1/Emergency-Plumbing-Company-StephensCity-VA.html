<p>No other room in a house consists of as lots of pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. Whether you need electric, gas, or tankless water heaters, we have the right one for your house.

In all seriousness though, making sure your trip lever is working well can conserve you the trouble of those little daily inconveniences - that the majority of people simply cope with and never realize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to mention the gallons of water wasted every day by a poor seal.</p>
