<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General. Within the building envelope consisting of below grade, if less than 10-percent (small) of the existing piping for a sub-system, fixture, or system  group is changed, a license and inspection will not be needed. This shall not preclude the licensee from acquiring authorizations and inspections for such work if so wanted.</p>

This increases the cost of domestic water heating by about fifteen to twenty percent. Dark Blue = Supply-side pressure (for instance, 100 psi) presses versus the # 1 check and also fills the area on the "high pressure" side of the Relief Valve diaphram, pushing it closed.</p>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. If permitted to return to the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to end up being a health danger. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for efficiency, along with checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
