Reduced pressure in the pipe may enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>As described earlier in the short article, carbon monoxide is totally odor-free and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every house ought to have carbon monoxide detectors set up at the appropriate places. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family residences to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are usually offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all new installations must have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
