No, it is not a frequent event, but it does take place more frequently than you believe! Typically it takes place during the night when you don't see the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding areas.</p>
