<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were timely and very responsive to send me a quote which was very competitive. They were extremely professional and did an amazing task. I would absolutely call them once again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this staining only appears when hot water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes.

<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
