Too often we see disposal units ruined by improper installation. Taking a shortcut by installing it yourself can typically cause an absence of efficiency and frequent repairs down the line.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a process called ion exchange.
