<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber SanClemente CA</h3>
<p>Plumbing and piping innovation has actually improved over the last 30 years. Copper has actually been the preferred option to replace galvanized iron pipes (which used to be thought about very strong, however they were found to split under pressure and tend to rust within a few years). Today, a lot of quality contractors use PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were timely and very responsive to send me a bid which was extremely competitive. They were extremely professional and did an amazing job. I would definitely call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration just appears when warm water is being utilized, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still a problem that needs to be handled right away (you'll likely need a new water heater) however not one that needs repiping.</p>
