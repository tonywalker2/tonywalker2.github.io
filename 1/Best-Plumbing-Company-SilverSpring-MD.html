You need to wait till after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regrowth. You ought to also examine to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed.
