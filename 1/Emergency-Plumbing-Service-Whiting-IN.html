<p>A lot of softeners have a bypass developed into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to provide some kind of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you select does not have a bypass, then it's smart to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to keep the system.</p>
