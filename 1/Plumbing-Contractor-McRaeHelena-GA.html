<p>The heating element is taking longer to warm the water than it should if the water feels warm. But this particular problem is when you have no hot water streaming in your home. The reasons for this can range from leakages, malfunctioning or faulty electrical wiring, or a broken heating element or thermostat. If it is among the mentioned problems, a repair or replacement of the components might be adequate. However, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems happening frequently, then a water heater replacement is needed.</p>
