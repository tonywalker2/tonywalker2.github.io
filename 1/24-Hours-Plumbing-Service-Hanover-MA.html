<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some disposer systems do not come with a power cord connected. Remove the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1) if this is the case. Be sure to purchase an electrical wiring package with the appropriate power ranking and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). When you connect the wiring harness to the disposer, ensure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cord.</p>

This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Numerous brand-new homes are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>
