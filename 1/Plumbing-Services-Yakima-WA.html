As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather an annoyance-- for its many intended uses around your home.</p>
