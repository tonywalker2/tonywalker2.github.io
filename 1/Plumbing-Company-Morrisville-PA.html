After we have cleaned up the body, and the repaired elements are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or particles. This can be tricky, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around.
