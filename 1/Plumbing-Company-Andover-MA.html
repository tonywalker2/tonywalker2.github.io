<p>Rust is an intricate phenomenon and there are numerous factors that speed up rust in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For many years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it crucial to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that accelerate corrosion Likewise, there is an absence of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective form of rust control.
