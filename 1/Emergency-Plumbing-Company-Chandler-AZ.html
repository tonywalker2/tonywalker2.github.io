<p>Everyday use should not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also occur if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the unit in a stable and safe place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you ought to wait until after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings.

Hard water destroys warm water home appliances. The greater the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and solidify into solid deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
