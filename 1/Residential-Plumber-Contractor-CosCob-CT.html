If you live in an older home, your sink might not have one, forcing you to be thorough about keeping food scraps from flowing down the drain. It's likewise possible for a disposal to unexpectedly break, bringing cooking or cleanup to a grinding stop. Copper pipes = $1.50-$ 2.00 per linear foot.

However, they're likewise the most pricey in this list and in locations with tough water (like Florida) they can establish pinhole leaks.</p>

If everything is ready, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or more of time. If things need to be customized, replaced, or transferred to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and for that reason the overall expenses. Many plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with most disposal setups running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
