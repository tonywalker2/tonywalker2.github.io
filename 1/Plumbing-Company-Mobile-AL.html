<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is comprised of six State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, one of which is also acts as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Strategy Inspector for the group. There are few circumstances when plumbing inspections are necessary, however the biggest exceptions are building and home updates.
