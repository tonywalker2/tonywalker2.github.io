<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Ashland OH</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
<p>Mixing evaporated salt with rock salt is not recommended, as this could clog the softening tank. It is recommended that you permit your unit to go empty of one kind of salt before adding another to avoid the occurrence of any problems. In any case, when you're preparing a water heater replacement, play it safe. Call your local department of inspections and ask if you need an authorization. And make certain a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
