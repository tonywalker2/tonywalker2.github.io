<p>Like any household home appliance, hot water heater require routine maintenance to operate securely and effectively.

<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- essentially 2 layers of protection. The device permits water to push the check valves open when water is entering into the building, however closes them shut when water tries to go the incorrect way. There are 2 different types of testable backflow prevention gadgets that are commonly defined-- a decreased pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device. There are a few others that I will mention but do not get hung up on them. Because they will be on an accreditation test, I mention them only.</p>
