For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it crucial to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that accelerate corrosion Likewise, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of rust control. Therefore, thinking about all these elements, along with arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
