<p>Backflow preventers are important for creating a safe water supply system. No matter which design you choose, all water softeners need to be appropriately maintained. The salt water service should be blended and kept in the salt water tank. Periodic clogging of the resin also requires special attention. For instance, if the raw supply of water is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, typical backwashing with water will solve this issue. If not, slowly stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help separate the product. Also, fungis and bacteria also form mats in the resin that decrease its effectiveness. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these nuisances. However, check out the maker's directions prior to including any chemicals to the system.</p>
<p>Woodbury, in addition to many other communities and companies, has actually discovered the very best way to avoid these stains from occurring is by decreasing the variety of times your water softener restores. "Restoring" refers to the method softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "exhausted" or complete. Nevertheless, lots of water softeners regrow frequently, when the filter medium actually isn't full. This can be fixed by simply resetting your water softener to eliminate less hardness or to run longer between regeneration cycles.</p>
