<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is an unexpected decrease in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as throughout fire combating or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This turnaround can develop a suction impact and draw prospective impurities into the potable (drinking) water supply. Tank hot water heater are typically found in a lot of homes. Their parts are an insulated tank, normally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water till it's needed.
