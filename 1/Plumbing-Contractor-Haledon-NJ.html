<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
