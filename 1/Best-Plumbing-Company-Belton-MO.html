<p>Covert water leaks are often difficult and have Potentially Severe Consequences. Replacing your flapper may require somewhat different steps than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To find a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, however possibilities are you'll locate one of the exact same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>

<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that regulates water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't set up appropriately, you might experience a frequently or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>
