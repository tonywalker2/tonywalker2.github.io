<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>

The response is: you need backflow prevention if you have a cooking water connection that might be utilized to supply a sprinkler system.</p>
