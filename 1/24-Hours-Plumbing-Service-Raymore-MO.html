They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate solidity from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
