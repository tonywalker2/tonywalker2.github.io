<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
