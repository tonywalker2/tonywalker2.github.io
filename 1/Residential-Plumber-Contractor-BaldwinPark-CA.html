When chemicals are included to a fire protection system provided by a safe and clean water supply, increased protection is also required. If you have children, remind them to avoid holding on any visible pipelines or having fun with the outdoor gas meter. Hanging on a pipeline might cause it to come loose or break, releasing gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter ought to be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly available in an emergency.</p>
