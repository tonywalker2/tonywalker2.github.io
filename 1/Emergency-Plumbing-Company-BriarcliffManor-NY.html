<p>As discussed previously in the post, carbon monoxide gas is colorless and entirely odor-free. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every house needs to have carbon monoxide detectors set up at the proper locations. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family residences to have both smoke and carbon monoxide gas detectors. They are normally sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new setups must have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
<p>Backpressure is created when pressure in a water supply surpasses the pressure in the potable system supplying the make-up water. This can force the potable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Possible contaminants can then enter the safe and clean water system. The best method to decrease accumulation is have a professional flush it at least once a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially tough with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more often.</p>
<p>Some of the reasons for drain line clogs in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a failing garbage disposal, or too much food being disposed down the drain.
