<p>Backflow is dangerous because it can contaminate the general public drinking supply with impurities like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and harmful chemicals.

<p>The easiest way to keep you and your family safe from the prospective threats of backflow through cross connections is to not produce cross connections in the very first location. Nevertheless, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, pool, water function or other kind of cross connection, have actually an authorized backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
