In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically restrict the water circulation, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

<p>New houses built with copper pipes are specifically vulnerable to destructive water conditions because the copper pipes have not had a possibility to become covered inside. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new house for a period of 3 to five months after tenancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Many brand-new homes are built with PEX and not copper.</p>
