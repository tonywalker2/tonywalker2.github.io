<p>We deal with commercial designers and contractors to carry out plumbing jobs in a timely and economical  manner.

<p>Does it look like your drains are constantly slow or clogged? Often, this is caused by built-up sediment and other products that are triggering a clog in your sewer drain. Where other drain cleaning and plumbing companies will try to charge you an arm and a leg to dig up and clean your sewer line, Northwest Drain Station uses hydro jetting, a highly effective solution for dislodging persistent materials that have actually stayed with the walls of your pipeline, restoring a healthy circulation to your drains.</p>
<p>Suspect you have an issue? You may have the ability to fix minor problems by yourself. If not, Apollo House's skilled and licensed plumbers will do what it requires to get your waste disposal unit boning up again or install a new one, typically on the same day. Once again, it all boils down to how your policy is worded, but for the most part, homeowner's insurance coverage won't cover whole-home replumbing, simply the cost to repair a broken pipe and water damage.</p>
