If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be used. Though it may require extra adapters, versatile tubing is far simpler to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>

If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is designed to open and discharge water to the outside. An RPZ will occasionally release small amounts of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ must be installed in areas that are exempt to water damage and enable appropriate drainage.</p>
