Water softening equipment can be quickly removed, so you can take it with you if you move.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
