<p>For instance, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Due to the fact that pressure is lost throughout these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will flow in reverse into the city water lines. Although an EcoWater dealer does not support your area currently, we enjoy to help you with an alternative solution. You can buy, with complimentary shipping, a leading name-brand filtration or softener system by shopping at Any installation services below can then help with installation, or you can just install the system yourself.</p>
<p>When completion user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water flows in the typical direction from the supplier, downstream to fill the user's need. The flow of water presses the spring-loaded check valves open. The stress of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure difference in the Zone of Reduced Pressure. This difference in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water streams in the typical instructions.</p>
