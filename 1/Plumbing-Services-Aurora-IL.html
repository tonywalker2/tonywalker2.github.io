<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall.
