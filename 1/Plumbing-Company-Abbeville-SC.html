<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
