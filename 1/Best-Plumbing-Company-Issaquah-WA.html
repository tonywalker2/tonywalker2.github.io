<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has space to hold on to positive ions. The fresh media begins by holding on to the weaker charged salt ions. As tough water travels through your water softener tank, the more powerful charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Because the firmness minerals have a higher favorable charge than the salt, they will knock the sodium ions off and take their place.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that go through fouling, use or fatigue. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be tested regularly to guarantee they are operating correctly. A visual check of air gaps is sufficient, but mechanical backflow preventers have to be evaluated with effectively calibrated gauge equipment.</p>
