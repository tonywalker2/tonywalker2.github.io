<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical flow direction within a piping system that is brought on by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical circulation in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>When compared to gas designs, electrical models are easier and less costly to install as electrical power is currently readily available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a particular gas line has to be installed and a viable source of gas developed. Another feature of an electric water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas models need to be ventilated properly using vents and ducts in order to operate properly. With electrical designs, you will not need to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
