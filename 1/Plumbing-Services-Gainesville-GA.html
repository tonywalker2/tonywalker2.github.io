For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
