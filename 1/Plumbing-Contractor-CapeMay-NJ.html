<p>Most plumbers will get rid of the old unit to install the new one at the very same hourly rate. This can increase the amount of time needed to install the new unit, therefore increasing expenses. This actually depends upon what condition the remainder of the pipes are in, and how tough the old unit is to get rid of. In a lot of cases, elimination will just include an additional $25 to $50 to the overall expenses, however sometimes the costs might be greater if extra pipes must likewise be changed.</p>
<p>Push the pointer of a screwdriver up versus the edge of the plug and tap till you break out the plug. Then remove this plastic disc from inside the disposal (you can most likely hold the system upside down and shake it out). There are different types and designs of sink faucets, and your Good Guy plumber knows how to repair them all, and can likewise use installation of a new faucet if needed. We have complete self-confidence that we can manage any kind of repair you toss at us.</p>
<p>If there's an existing disposal, use the handy self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. Several homes in my neighborhood being repiped and have spoken with next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Obviously it starts with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can cause significant damage if the leak isn't discovered quickly.</p>
