<p>Root Invasion: Root invasion refers to what happens when tree roots start to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This happens due to the fact that the moisture in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots eventually do piece your drain lines, they can cause obstructions, breaks, and back-ups which might lead to substantial residential or commercial property damage. Look out for moist, green spots in your lawn, a relentless sewage smell in or around your house, an uptick in insect and rodent activity, and slow drains, as these are all typical signs of root invasion.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Cost Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were timely and very responsive to send me a quote which was very competitive. They were really professional and did an awesome task. I would absolutely call them once again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this staining only appears when warm water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is naturally still an issue that needs to be dealt with right away (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) however not one that requires repiping.</p>
