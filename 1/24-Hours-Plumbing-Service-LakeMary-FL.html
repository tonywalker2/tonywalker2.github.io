<p>Backflow threatens since it can contaminate the public drinking supply with contaminants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and damaging chemicals.

It is the 2nd highest energy consuming area of a house, next to heating & cooling. The quantity of minerals dissolved in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>
<p>Mechanical water softening units are for that reason likewise known as ion exchange water softeners.
