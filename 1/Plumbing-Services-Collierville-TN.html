<p>Troubleshooting is an issue. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I encounter scenarios, quite often that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job. Sometimes, the basements are so full of sewage, I can not securely get in the basement and operate till the sewage is extracted and the basement is typically cleaned. I 'd enjoy to post some photos of this. Just look on line. The issue does exist.</p>
<p>If you  want to eliminate the salt, just fill the brine tank with potassium chloride pellets, not salt pellets. The only issue is that potassium chloride is pricey: $25 to $30 per 50-pound bag. Salt costs $4 to $6 per bag. A hydro jetter is a pump-and-hose system that uses high-powered water jets to clear residential and commercial drain pipes. Many high-pressure water jetters will operate with up to 4,000 PSI of pressure and will push anywhere from 2-18 gallons of water per minute through a pipe.</p>
