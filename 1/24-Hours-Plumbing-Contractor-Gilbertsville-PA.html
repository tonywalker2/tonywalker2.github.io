<p>Inside the home, inspect the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for leakages or drips. Examine beneath sinks to look for leaking pipes. Local plumber quoted cost of $400 to install plus cost of garbage disposal. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ pleased I checked around. Under the sink, position a container or pan beneath the drain, then utilize locking-jaw pliers or a pipe wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's waste pipe. To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
