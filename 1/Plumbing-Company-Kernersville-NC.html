<p>Installed 50 gallon electric water heater, thermal expansion tank and tank booster. With modern-day water softeners, it is very possible to take them along during moving. Installation techniques involve quick fitting connections, similar to those used for laundry makers. It is essential for property owners to ensure that gas lines are replaced the proper way.

<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
