<p>Our team is ready to handle your plumbing concern. From regular service to intricate setups, our objective is to surpass your expectations. A license and inspections are required for most residential jobs including patios, additions, and devices such as air conditioning system and hot water heater. If new work is performed such as replacement of gas piping, a strategy might be needed to obtain the authorization.</p>

A drain professional like TLC will utilize a camera to inspect your drain system. Often, if you have multiple drain problems you may have a drain line break somewhere in your house or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can determine the issue and find so the drain can be repaired.</p>
<p>A plumbing authorization provides for 3 inspections. Additional inspections are $50.00 each. Inspections employed on work not completed, not appropriately installed, or on an unattainable home will need re-inspection. It is the authorization holder's duty to reschedule the inspection and make provisions for the plumbing inspector to access the home.</p>

Loosen the coupling nut that connects the supply line. If the toilet valve turns inside the toilet tank, hold its base with a locking pliers. Pointer: Throw a towel on the floor underneath to catch water that will drain from the line.</p>
