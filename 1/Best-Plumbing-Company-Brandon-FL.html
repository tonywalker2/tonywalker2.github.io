<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to avoid backflow. The fundamental means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow.

The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
<p>Your disposer may feature a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, rather of the standard plumber's putty as described listed below. Both will develop an excellent seal (though the gasket might lead to small amounts of water collecting around the flange), and what's used is largely a matter of preference. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to get rid of.</p>
