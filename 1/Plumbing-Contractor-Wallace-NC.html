<p>A lot of toilets utilized today operate with a standard gravity flushing style, meaning they utilize the force of the gravity to press the clean water into the bowl and then on into the sewage system. Just recently, however, toilets using a vacuum flushing system have been appearing in a growing number of homes.

A drawback of this device is that it's much more difficult to unblock your toilet were to become clogged.</p>

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the reason for the problem. The line was clearly weakening; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
