<p>The Last Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that controls water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't set up effectively, you may experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>
