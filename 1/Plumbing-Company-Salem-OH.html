<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
