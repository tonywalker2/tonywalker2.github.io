<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Cornelius NC</h3>

As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a nuisance-- for its numerous intended uses around your home.</p>
