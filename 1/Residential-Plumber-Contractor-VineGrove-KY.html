<p>The majority of softeners have actually a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to provide some kind of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you select does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to develop one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to keep the unit.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can buy models with special functions that do whatever but include the salt, you will pay for each extra feature. The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm warranty that the unique function will not stop working. Depending upon the water source, you might have to filter turbid water or sanitize bacteria-laden water-all prior to it even reaches the softening system. Lastly, if you own a septic system, you must consider the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regeneration. Estimates show that about 50 gallons of water are utilized for each regeneration cycle. This might or might not trigger hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
