<p>The majority of softeners have actually a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to provide some kind of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it.

Lastly, if you own a septic system, you must consider the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regeneration.
