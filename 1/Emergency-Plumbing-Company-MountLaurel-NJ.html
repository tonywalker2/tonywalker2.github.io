<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most devastating and widespread water problems: tough water.  Tough water ruined the modern-day house. Scale builds up in your pipes, blocking them and reducing water pressure.  Scale considerably shortens the life expectancy of appliances like dishwashers, coffee makers and ice machines. Hard water destroys hot water home appliances.

<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets should absolutely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>

Whether your present toilet requires repairs or you want to install a newer, more eco-friendly toilet, our Fredericksburg, VA plumbers can assist. We are devoted to serving the needs of households throughout Virginia. A last inspection after all work licensed by the plumbing license has actually been completed.</p>

<p>5. Put warm water down your drain after utilizing the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, wash your drain with a little bit of hot water.
