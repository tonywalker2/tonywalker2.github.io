<p>If your polybutylene pipes have failed, read your insurance plan completely. Make sure you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Lots of insurance provider will not cover a sluggish leak. Claims may be denied due to the fact that the basic HO-3 house owners' policy particularly excludes "a loss as the result of a water leak over an extended period of time." Call your insurance coverage representative and validate your coverage. Double check with your agent to confirm that your understanding is appropriate once you have read through your policy and confirmed what is covered and what is not covered.</p>
