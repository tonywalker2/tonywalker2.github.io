<p>Domestic water that arrives to your Ohio home carries minerals that can trigger rust on metal parts and components.

By having the anode rod examined regularly and replaced as required, you can double the life of your hot water heater.</p>
<p>The consumer has one month to complete installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (examine the due date on Notice of Requirements form).

<p>Even if you think you can handle it on your own, you most likely don't have a camera appropriate for diagnosing the reason for obstruction around bends in your pipes. You may even have a drain snake helpful, but when's the last time you used it-- and are you sure you're doing it right? In some cases the very best thing you can do for your home is call someone with the right tools and knowledge to fix your issue rapidly and efficiently.

<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically starts. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regrowth typically takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
