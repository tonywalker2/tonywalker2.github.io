An authorization is not required for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided modifications are not made in the existing piping or components.

A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a nearby drain or drywell.</p>
