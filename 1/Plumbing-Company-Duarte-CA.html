<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual preference. A license is not required for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions provided modifications are not made in the existing piping or components.

A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a nearby drain or drywell.</p>
<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and bacteria from ending up being a problem in your water supply by sending an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system.
