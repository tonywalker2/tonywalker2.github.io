Our comprehensive water quality program runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water delivered to our clients is kept devoid of damaging impurities. A vital part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices containing a nonpotable substance, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination might take place when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or cooling and heating system, into the safe and clean water supply. This can take place through a procedure known as backflow.</p>
