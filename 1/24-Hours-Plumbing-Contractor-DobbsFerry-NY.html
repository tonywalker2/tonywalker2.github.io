<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service DobbsFerry NY</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
