These materials adhere to the side of the pipe wall and harden over time, creating a persistent clog that is typically hard to get rid of.

<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
