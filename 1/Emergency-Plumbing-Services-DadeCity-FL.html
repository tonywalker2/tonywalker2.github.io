<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
