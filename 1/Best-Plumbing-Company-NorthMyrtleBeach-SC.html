A decreased pressure backflow preventer is the top of the line when it pertains to backflow preventers, and is the device of choice because it can withstand the introduction of fertilizer or other chemicals, it's also a sensible choice for residential water systems.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
