<p>Why risk an insurance claim on a flooded home when selecting a licensed and insured  plumbing contractor is just an easy telephone call away.

<p>When compared to gas models, electrical designs are easier and less expensive to install as electrical power is currently offered through the main power supply line.

Gas designs need to be aerated correctly using vents and ducts in order to work properly. With electric designs, you will not need to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
