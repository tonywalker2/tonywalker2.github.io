Calcium, magnesium and numerous other minerals carry positive charges, so water softeners utilize salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with potable water, you are required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection.

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the offender. But not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
