<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips in Tunkhannock PA</h3>
<p>Visible odor. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like odor) in the backyard, basement, or anywhere in your home or company location, give us a call. That smell might be originating from your sewer system, which requires repair work right now. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and controls atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has stopped working, it will often need to be changed instead of repaired. If your pipes are gurgling or discharging nasty odors, you'll know this.</p>
<p>Wood pipes were used in London and in other places during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and avenues, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
<p>Often you know you have a sewer line break because you can smell foul odors or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is necessary to pinpoint the specific place of the break in your sewer line. Many times the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and understanding this can save you countless dollars in repairs. Merely sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can solve the issue. The professionals and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you always have a copy for your insurance coverage company, real estate agent or city inspector.</p>
