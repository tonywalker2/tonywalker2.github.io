<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Atlanta GA</h3>
<p>Polybutylene utilized inside your home can be found near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks. Caution: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Due to the fact that copper is showing does not suggest you do not have polybutylene pipes, simply. You might have to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
