The GFAVB is a non-testable system and benefit back siphonage only for non-health threat or health hazard conditions. They should be installed downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It needs to also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local authorities, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some towns do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only safeguard against back siphonage.</p>
