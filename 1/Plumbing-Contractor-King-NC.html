<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services King NC</h3>
<p>With tank warm water heaters, you have a sizeable tank that holds and heats up water. The heating aspect can be by means of making use of gas, oil, or electricity. The gas water heaters make use of gas or LPG to heat up the water. The gas designs are also more economical to operate than the electrical types and are a preferred for commercial and residential purposes. As for the advantages of electric tank water heaters, they are more secure and much easier to maintain compared to their gas counterparts.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
