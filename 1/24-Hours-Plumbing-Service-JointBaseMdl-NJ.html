<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
