Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Throughout regular operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of lowered pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is designed to discharge and open water to the exterior.

For this factor, the RPZ should be set up in locations that are exempt to water damage and permit adequate drainage.</p>
