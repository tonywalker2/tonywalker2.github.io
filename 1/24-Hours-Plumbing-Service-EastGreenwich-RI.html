<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
