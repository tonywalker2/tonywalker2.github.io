<p>Searching for prompt Albuquerque emergency plumbing services? When sewer line breaks, it often triggers the yard above it to become soaked. You might smell the revolting odor of sewage prior to you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (hopefully shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it essential to cordon off that part of your lawn. Due to the fact that the swampiness will bring in unwelcome animals, the situation is fraught with problems.
