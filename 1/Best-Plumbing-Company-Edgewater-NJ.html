<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the glory in the toilet world, however the trip lever is the bridge in between man and machine. After all, if the trip lever doesn't lift the flapper to flush the toilet, you need to jiggle and wiggle and sometimes even stick your hand in there and lift the flapper manually. And who wishes to do all that work??? In all severity however, making sure your trip lever is working well can save you the inconvenience of those little daily hassles - that the majority of people just deal with and never realize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to mention the gallons of water squandered every day by a bad seal.</p>

Brooks found just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
