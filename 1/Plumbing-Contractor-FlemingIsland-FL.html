<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and intricate plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping. Plumbing problems aren't just hard to discover, they're also capable of triggering some major damage. Pinhole leaks, for example, are so small that they just launch a number of droplets at a time.
