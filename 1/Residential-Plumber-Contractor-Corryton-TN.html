<p>As discussed previously in the article, carbon monoxide gas is colorless and entirely odor-free. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every house must have carbon monoxide gas detectors set up at the proper places. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family homes to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are typically sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all new installations need to have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
