<p>We're changing a gas water heater in our demonstration. The steps for changing a propane hot water heater are exactly the same, and those for an electric water heater are comparable. Recurring leaks and repairs. If your hot water heater is over 10 years old, it has actually likely lost much of its effectiveness; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. As a result, we advise changing your unit if it is over 10 years old.</p>
<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is normally used in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
