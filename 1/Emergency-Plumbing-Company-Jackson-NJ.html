The reasons for this can vary from leaks, defective or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating element or thermostat. If it is among the mentioned concerns, a repair or replacement of the components might be sufficient. Nevertheless, if the water heater system has all of these problems occurring frequently, then a water heater replacement is needed.</p>
