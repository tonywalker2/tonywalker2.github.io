<p>Pretty little flappers may get all the splendor in the toilet world, however the journey lever is the bridge in between man and machine. After all, if the trip lever does not lift the flapper to flush the toilet, you need to wiggle and jiggle and in some cases even stick your hand in there and raise the flapper manually. And who wishes to do all that work??? In all seriousness though, making certain your journey lever is working well can save you the hassle of those little everyday inconveniences - that the majority of people simply live with and never ever understand they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to mention the gallons of water wasted every day by a poor seal.</p>

Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet.
