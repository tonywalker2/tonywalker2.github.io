<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct impact on your safety, benefit, comfort, and reliability than your plumbing system. This is exceptionally crucial! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system. Present policies restrict the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We provide two types of water treatment systems for hard water: Advantage Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
