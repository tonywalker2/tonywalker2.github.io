<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
