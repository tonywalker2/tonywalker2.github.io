So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers manage all types of work.

They were really responsive and prompt to send me a quote which was very competitive. They were very professional and did a remarkable task. I would definitely call them once again for my plumbing requires. Now, if this discoloration only appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust probably exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still a problem that needs to be handled right now (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
