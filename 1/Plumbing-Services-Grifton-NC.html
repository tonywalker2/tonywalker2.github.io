<p>Water solidity is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the difference on your skin is due to the fact that soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum. This leads to the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. Which's where the term firmness" came from ... it's difficult to wash in.</p>
<p>After arriving after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but claimed they wouldn't take responsibility if it dripped now since of some undefined oddities in how my sink was put together. After they offered me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, since I never wish to see this company once again.</p>
