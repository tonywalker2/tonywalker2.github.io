<p>Lots of bad things are being stated on this article about liners. I find that lots of old time plumbers are not informed on liners and have no idea on what they are stating. Will also say something does not work well just since they do not like the innovation and not because it doesn't work. If this heater is set up in a house with several restrooms, the piping process contributes to the installation expenses.</p>
<p>It might be time to get it replaced if your water heater has needed several repairs over the last few years. An excellent rule of thumb for hot water heater is this: since the life-span of the average hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. If the cost of a repair is majority the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more monetary sense to replace your hot water heater.</p>
<p>With drain line cleaning, you understand your pipes are sparkly clean. With repairs, you understand they're in good shape. And with lining, you know they'll be secure for many years to come.
