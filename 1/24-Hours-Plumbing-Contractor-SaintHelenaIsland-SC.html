<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which designs are best for particular applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are spelled out by environmental regulations and local statutes. Local building regulations for example will need a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air space in between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any possible siphon prior to it can happen, preventing infecting water from being drawn back into the pipe system.

The GFAVB is a non-testable system and benefit back siphonage only for non-health danger or health risk conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet). Some municipalities do not permit the usage of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just secure against back siphonage.</p>
