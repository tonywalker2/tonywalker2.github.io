<p>Obvious smell. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like odor) in the yard, basement, or throughout your house or service area, give us a call. That smell may be originating from your sewer system, which requires repair work immediately. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that removes sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and controls atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually stopped working, it will often need to be replaced instead of repaired.

We provide a variety of affordable and extremely effective systems, and provide upfront rates before work begins so there are not a surprises. It is our objective to offer all of our valued customers throughout Albuquerque and the surrounding locations the service they need at a cost they can pay for.</p>
