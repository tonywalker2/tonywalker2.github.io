As building types and contents of these buildings can be extremely different, we need to understand that the fire security system for any installation needs to be designed and set up to satisfy that particular risk or need. An airplane garage will need an extremely different fire defense system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow defense requirements for these two examples would likewise vary greatly.</p>
